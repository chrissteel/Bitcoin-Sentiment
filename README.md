CMGT 597A&B

This repository will contain all source code, data, visualizations for my 597A&B Project for USC Annenberg's CMGT Program.

The project will use either a News API or web scraper to gather articles about Bitcoin, and then perform a sentiment analysis on them to test for correlation and feedback between news sentiment and Bitcoin prices.

Sample_API_Call.py is the code I'm currently using to get data from the web, but may switch to a different method if I can't get enough this way.
