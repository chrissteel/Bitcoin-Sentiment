# Practicum
CMGT 597A&B

This repository will contain all source code, data, visualizations for my CMGT 597A&B Project.
The project will use either a News API or web scraper to gather articles about Bitcoin, and then perform a sentiment analysis on them to test for correlation and feedback between news sentiment and Bitcoin prices.
