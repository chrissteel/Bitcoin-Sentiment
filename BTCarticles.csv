On Saturday, bitcoin cash miners met to discuss funding for a bitcoin cash development fund, he told CNBC.

In the fund, miners are ""going to take some of the rewards they get from mining and put it in a fund to build stuff on top of bitcoin cash,"" Kelly said on ""Fast Money.""

""That's how blockchains gain value,"" he added. ""You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash.""

""That's a place I want to buy,"" said Kelly, who is founder and CEO of BKCM, an investment firm focused on digital currencies.

Bitcoin cash was priced at $1,233.25 at 6 p.m. ET Monday. While it declined from its $1,300 price the week of May 14, bitcoin cash was still valued significantly higher than its April 17 level of $763.

The crypto market watchers were expecting the most notable digital coin of all, bitcoin, to rally during Blockchain Week New York. Instead, the coin declined about 10 percent, briefly falling below the $8,000 level. Bitcoin, priced around $8,400 Monday at 5:30 p.m. ET, is down about 5 percent in the last month.",cnbc.com

Would you be tempted to invest? Now what if someone told you that the same investment also could lose most or all of its value almost overnight, and that you might not have access to your money when you need it? How does it sound now? You've just confronted the debate surrounding the digital phenomenon known as Bitcoin. An alternative currency that exists strictly as digital code, Bitcoin has received a lot of attention. But is it an investment? A scam? A network of computers? The future of currency? If you're unclear on what all the fuss is about, here's a brief introduction to just what it is, how it works, and some of the potential pitfalls it presents.

Bitcoin as currency

Bitcoin isn't a company but a virtual currency supported by a peer-to-peer computer-based electronic cash system first outlined in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. To understand how the currency works, you have to understand where it comes from. Unlike printed currency or coins that are minted, Bitcoin is created by ""mining"" -- using complex software to solve complicated mathematical computations (or contracting with a mining company to do it for you). Solving a problem creates a so-called ""block,"" and the computer that solved it is rewarded with a set number of digital bitcoins, each of which is simply a set of one public and one private cryptographic key. (The units are generally ""bitcoins,"" while the general system is ""Bitcoin."") The number of solutions that can be discovered globally per hour (and thus the number of ""blocks"" created and bitcoins mined) is limited by the system's software code. The total number of bitcoins available to be mined eventually is said to be limited to 21 million. However, most users acquire them either by buying them with physical currencies such as dollars or accepting them as payment for goods and services. Advocates argue that the advantages of the system

are: (1) it's not controlled by any government's central bank, (2) a global virtual currency facilitates global commercial transactions, (3) every block and Bitcoin transaction is recorded, and (4) though transactions are recorded, the payer and payee are anonymous, much like a cash transaction. (However, that anonymity has attracted charges that its chief use so far has been for illegal activities such as money laundering; in October 2013, the FBI shut down the Silk Road Bitcoin exchange and seized its assets.)

How does a Bitcoin payment work?

Just as a physical wallet holds paper money and change, a digital wallet stores the private software keys that are bitcoins. It makes or receives payments by communicating with the network of other Bitcoin wallets. Some merchants and services, especially those that focus on online or international sales, are starting to explore Bitcoin transactions. Physical bitcoins, which have a software key embedded in them, have begun to be minted. However, acceptance of bitcoins as payment is entirely at a seller's discretion; there is no guarantee you'll be able to spend them where you want to or get the value you expect. Also, as outlined below, problems at some exchanges have sometimes impeded access to Bitcoin funds. Note: Bitcoin payments are irreversible. Once you complete a transaction, it cannot be reversed. Purchases can be refunded, but that depends solely on the willingness of the establishment to do so.

Speculating in Bitcoin

Bitcoin's usage as a currency is a ripple compared to the tidal waves of investment speculation it has fueled. ""Investing"" in bitcoins simply means acquiring them through one of the methods outlined above. However, to say that Bitcoin as an investment is volatile is an understatement. Over its history, its value has fluctuated wildly as speculation and confidence in it have ebbed and surged. Despite its lack of connection to any central bank, Bitcoin also has been vulnerable to actions by individual governments. After China cracked down in 2013 on virtual currency transactions by financial institutions and halted deposits of yuan at exchanges there, Bitcoin's worth in dollars was cut by more than half.* More recently, China banned offerings of new cryptocurrencies and commercial exchanges in September 2017. In January 2018, Chinese regulators ordered the closing of mining operations that were creating more than three-fourths of the world's supply of Bitcoin.** At the beginning of 2017, one Bitcoin was worth about $1,000. As the year progressed, the price of the cryptocurrency soared more than 1,900% to a high of $19,187 on December 16, 2017, attracting plenty of attention from the financial media and awestruck investors. Bitcoin followed up that startling performance by plunging more than 69% to $5,920 between December 17, 2017 and February 6, 2018, and then bouncing back up to the $10,000 range by the end of the same month.* That volatility has led to problems for people trying to make payments in bitcoins. It's hard to use a currency when you're not sure from day to day whether the amount in your virtual wallet is worth enough to buy a Range Rover or a tank of gas. Complicating the issue is the fact that the value can vary on different Bitcoin exchanges. However, volatility is only one of the problems that has created havoc from time to time in the Bitcoin universe. The cybercurrency has been subject to cyberattacks that have halted trading briefly on several exchanges. And at one point, one of the largest exchanges abruptly declared bankruptcy and announced that nearly half a billion dollars' worth of bitcoins held there had vanished (though a portion of that amount was subsequently said to have been located). Worse than not knowing how much your bitcoins will buy is not knowing whether they're available to buy anything at all. Hackers and bankruptcy aren't the only reasons Bitcoin holders could lose the ability to spend or exchange their funds. Because of the accusations of money laundering via Bitcoin, scrutiny of digital transactions is increasing. If a law enforcement agency seized the assets of a digital platform or exchange, as they did with Silk Road, access to digital wallets there could be restricted.

The Wild West rides again

So far, regulatory oversight of Bitcoin has been spotty. The currency is not backed by either a government or any physical asset such as gold. Major exchanges are located around the world, and the decentralized nature of the system makes it more challenging for governmental regulators to get a handle on it. Unlike accounts at FDIC-insured banks, there is no protection for possible loss from a digital wallet. Also, unlike credit card charges, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. The Internal Revenue Service has said it will treat Bitcoin holdings as property rather than as a currency for tax purposes. That means that the sale or exchange of bitcoins that have gained in value since they were acquired could potentially trigger a tax liability. Also, payments made in bitcoins are subject to the same information reporting requirements as any other payments made in property. And wages paid in bitcoins must be reported on a W-2 form and are taxable as income, just as any other wages would be. Speculation hasn't been limited to the currency itself. Much as the Internet did in its early days, Bitcoin also has spawned an entire ecosystem of startup companies and venture capitalists who want to be part of building out the technology and infrastructure involved in creating and transferring it. In addition to multiple exchanges, companies have begun providing data on the virtual currency's price and status and creating Bitcoin-based products. As with early Internet companies, such ventures are likely to involve a high degree of uncertainty and risk. Obviously, virtual currency still faces a lot of challenges. If you're considering exploring it, either for transactions or as a speculative investment, you should become far more familiar with it than simply relying on this discussion. And because of the issues outlined above, you should be prepared for dramatic price swings and only use money that you aren't relying on for something else.

Selling Bitcoin and booking profits now has obvious appeal. Currently trading at about $10,900, the Bitcoin price is up more than 1,000% in 2017 and more than 1,370% over the past 12 months.

That means $1,000 invested one year ago is worth $14,700 today. Even an investor who bought Bitcoin at $2,500 in July has gains of 335%.

But cashing out everything might not be the best strategy.

Here's what you need to consider before selling your Bitcoin...

The first issue you need to look at is taxation. Yes, your Bitcoin windfall is taxable. According the IRS, cryptocurrency profits are considered capital gains.

The federal capital gain tax for most middle-class Americans is 15%. And that doesn't count state and local taxes - unless you're lucky enough to live in a state that has no capital gains tax (Texas, Nevada, South Dakota, Florida, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Wyoming, and Washington).

Breaking: California Marijuana Legislation Sparks the Most Profitable Opportunity of 2018. Click Here for Details...

Most states take an additional 5%, although a few take quite a bit more. California, for instance, has no special treatment for capital gains, which means your gains will be taxed at the state's standard 13.3% rate. That's a big bite out of your Bitcoin bonanza.

Plus, a Bitcoin gain of hundreds of thousands of dollars could bump you into the higher 20% bracket. So if you have really large gains, you don't want to sell all of your Bitcoin in the same tax year.

And if you think you can cheat Uncle Sam by simply not reporting your gains, think again. Cashing out almost certainly will mean transferring your U.S. dollar proceeds to a bank.

By law, banks must report the deposit of any amount larger than $10,000 to the U.S. government (breaking up the amount into smaller deposits to evade the requirement is a crime). And banks may well report transactions far smaller than that, as Money Morning Capital Wave Strategist Shah Gilani found out a couple of years ago.

In short, the safest course of action is to pay taxes on your Bitcoin gains. Just make sure that when you sell your Bitcoin, you set aside 15% to 30% for your friends at the IRS.

But paying taxes isn't the only reason to think twice before cashing out your Bitcoin right now...

Although critics like to say Bitcoin is a bubble that will burst at any moment, they've been saying that at least since mid-2011, when the Bitcoin price spiked to a ridiculously high $30.

It's always possible the price of Bitcoin could collapse (that's true of just about any investment), but bubble fears aren't a good reason to sell your Bitcoin. Just ask the folks that cashed out at $20 (2011), or $200 (early 2013), or $1,000 (late 2013), or $2,500 (this past June).

Several respected analysts see the Bitcoin price moving significantly higher from here. Hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz told CNBC this week that the price of Bitcoin could get to $40,000 by the end of next year.

Meanwhile, Ronnie Moas, head of Standpoint Research, told the CoinTelegraph he sees the Bitcoin price reaching $15,000 in 2018. But over the next five to 10 years, he sees much bigger gains.

If Bitcoin captures just 1% of the $200 trillion of capital now invested in stocks, gold, cash, and bonds, Moas says it could reach as high as $125,000. That represents a 1,250% gain over a Bitcoin price of $10,000.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below.

Cryptocurrency mining, once a highly profitable venture, has become more challenging as costs have increased, especially in the past year.

Advanced Miners, a mining company that already operates a mine in northern China, has developed more economical mining equipment, an online mining cloud platform, and will open more mining farms.

Advanced Miners' goal is to make bitcoin more decentralized with more mining pools and more versatile mining hardware. The company's versatile equipment will make mining more accessible to many.

Not only is investment in mining is long-term, but the investments require an understanding of mining equipment, which is difficult to acquire for many.

Advanced Miners has responded to this need by introducing its own ASIC mining equipment based on 12 nanometer (nm) chip, which has been successfully tested. The chip will be launched for public sale by mid-year, and an ASIC based on 7 nm will be available by year's end.

The income from both the AMS-12 nm and ASM-7 nm has the potential to surpasses that of other mining equipment.

Following distribution of the new mining equipment, Advanced Miners will open its online cloud platform for people to buy and sell hash. Only the ACM token will be accepted for payment, which bodes well for the token's future value.

The company in 2016 launched its first bitcoin focused farm in northern China using Antminer ASIC from Bitmain. The best energy price at the time was $0.04 per KW. By April 2017, Litecoin and Ethereum farms were established, followed by Monero and Dash farms.

The announcement of the 12 nm chips coincided with the recent launch of the ICO, which released 12 million tokens and will last through June 15. The price is $0.9 per token, a 35% discount from final token price.

The second stage of the ICO will bring the main sale, with a token price of $1.2 for 5,000 to 10,000 units of ASIC AM-12. The ASIC AM-7 based on the 7 nm chip will be tested.

Hash rates will increase in steps following the ICO. The estimated hash rate after the ICO is 542.00 PH/s for SHA-245, then 1,650.00 PH/S after the buy/sell hash platform begins, then 3,800.00 PH/S after the launch of the cloud mining platform.

Advanced Miners' next step will be to establish a mining farm in Canada with an AMS-1 based on a 12 nm chip with an estimated electricity rate of $0.03 per KW. A large mining pool will launch by April of 2019.

Investors will be able to exchange or turn ACM tokens into hash power since mining profit and payments will be executed automatically. Users can purchase contracts for bitcoin mining with ASIC AM-12 and AM-7 with ACM tokens during the 2018-2019 period.

The company will not sell mining boards equipped with the 12 nm chips to the public, but only to its investors in its ICO.

ICO investors will have some advantages compared to other mining companies since they can choose whether to buy ASIC with delivery to their data centers or buy hash on the online platform with guaranteed cheap electricity.",ccn.com

In a post on Reddit, CoinGate, which has operated since 2014 but saw over half its transaction volume this year, confirmed it was operating LN in a ""sandbox environment"" while ""intense testing"" continues.

""Lightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,"" officials wrote.

...In the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech.

A lesser-known payment processor, CoinGate has sought to adhere to the latest technological innovations and best practices in Bitcoin, batching transactions since 2015 and implementing SegWit support in December last year.

By Contrast, larger operators such as BitPay and Coinbase have become known for the slow rate with which they adopt new technology.

Despite only existing as a Bitcoin mainnet implementation since the start of 2018, LN has meanwhile already attracted a considerable number of ardent supporters, both business and private.

CoinGate joins a select few to provide support for the protocol, which remains in a testing phase without guarantees of funds security.

In February, Bitcoinist reported, Blockstream opened a dedicated LN shop, a move which at the time attracted criticism due to Lightning's volatile - or experimental - nature.

For its sandbox effort, CoinGate has appealed for test users to accept Bitcoin payments, while acknowledging the technology's potential pitfalls.

""[T]here will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment,"" the Reddit post adds.

Last week, LN passed 2000 reachable nodes, while current network capacity is just over $163,000. At the same time, a comparison surfaced which drew attention to the considerable cost savings merchants can gain using Lightning over credit card payments.",bitcoinist.com
5,872236474,2018-05-21,19:09:00,2018-05-21T19:09:00Z,How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem? | NewsBTC,"If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th largest consumer of electricity in the world. A new research paper has highlighted the growing problem as major cryptocurrencies seek to solve it.

According to the figures, the amount of energy used for each transaction could run a dishwasher for a year.

Alex de Vries wrote: ""With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018."" This doesn't mean that Bitcoin transactions couldn't be processed without high amounts of energy, it's just that there are a lot of miners. Currently, miners earn about $100 per transaction.

Digiconomist estimates the consumption of electricity by Bitcoin Miners in its Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BEXI). According to its data, Bitcoin uses 67.91 TWh annually which is just greater than Chile, ranked 40th in the world at 66 TWh. They estimate that the amount of electricity used per transaction is higher at 929 kWh which would be the equivalent of running three dishwashers for a year. The main issue is that the figures are rising at a much steeper rate and have been since September 2017.

BEXI has to work backwards to calculate the energy used. It starts with how much money the miners are making and works out how much they probably spend on electricity. Then they consider the price of electricity and estimate how much is used. It does rely on several assumptions but it would be much harder to contact all Bitcoin miners and ask how much electricity they use.

The Lightning Network will take Bitcoin transactions off-chain by setting up channels between users. Transactions between them will occur and only be recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed. This will reduce the number of transactions that nodes will have to confirm and in doing so, will reduce the energy required for maintaining the network.

However, the majority of electricity used is for Bitcoin mining where computers generate hashes that fulfil a set of criteria. Reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain is unlikely to affect how many miners there are. Bitcoin transactions have halved since December but the mining difficulty has doubled, indicating there is twice as much mining equipment being used. This means that the Lightning Network will only be able to solve some of the problem.

In reality, the best bet for Bitcoin, using Proof-of-Work, is using renewable energy, as highlighted in a response to the paper. The International Energy Agency said that renewable energy is set to grow 40% by 2022 and highlighted that renewables are dominant in new energy sources being created. Iceland has already shown how it can work as it runs on 100% renewable energy. In essence, renewable electricity allows the Bitcoin Network to run without changing its underlying structure.

Other ways of solving the problem include moving to Proof-of-Stake as Ethereum is doing. Digiconomist estimate that Ethereum uses about a third of the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin. NewsBTC reported on the recent publication of the code for Casper. The move is likely to reduce electricity usage significantly, but the question is whether or not the network will remain secure.",newsbtc.com

The price rose to above $8,500 above the resistance at the 50-day moving average (MA). Coindesk analysis Coindesk's recent technical analysis of the present situation notes that although the bearish trend of last week seems to have run out of steam over the weekend the rally was based on low volume and so may run out of steam as well. The four-hour chart shows an inverse head and shoulders breakout. This indicate a reversal of the short-term bullish trend. The daily chart shows a bullish reversal. The 5-day and 10-day moving averages also are no longer sloping downward and hence do not signal a bearish bias. The signs are that bitcoin could again rally to test the $9,000 level this week. However, the bullish case is weakened by volume data. High volume tends to be bullish and low volume bearish. The trading volume of bitcoin (BTC) has been declining even as the price went up. Over the weekend, trading volume on all exchanges was only $5 billion the lowest level since April 11. The weekend rally may not be sustainable. Coindesk's outlook The article's conclusion is: ""BTC rally lacks substance (low volumes), hence the outlook is likely neutral, despite the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (4-hour chart) and the bullish doji reversal (daily chart). A failure to hold above $8,475 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would revive the bearish view and allow a drop to Friday's low of $7,925. On the higher side, only a high volume move above the 100-day moving average, currently seen at $8,857, would open the doors to $10,000."" Present situation The bitcoin price opened today above the $8,500 level at $8,520 . Since reaching a high of $8,566 the price has fallen to a low of $8,325. At 19:27 UTC the price was only marginally off the low at $8,343.10. While there a still more than four hours left in the day, the price could still go back to over $8,500 but right now it looks as if bitcoin will close below the $8,000 level no doubt a bearish sign according to the Coindesk analysis. The present price of bitcoin can be found here. Bitcoin not the only loser last week While bitcoin as the largest cryptocoin stole the limelight last week as it dropped 3.6 percent during the week it still did not do as bad as other well-known coins such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and EOS that both had double-digit losses. Others such as Zilliqa (ZIL) lost almost 20 percent the biggest loser among the top 25 currencies by capitalization. A Coindesk article has a graph showing losses and gains. Gainers, which were few, included zcash which rose 50 percent topping the list of winners as it was listed on a new exchange.",digitaljournal.com

I only treat Lending at Exchanges for now. (I might treat income from HFs and Arbitrage of the Basis in a follow-up piece.)

Lending Bitcoin

You can lend your Bitcoin to margin traders at BitMEX, Poloniex and Bitfinex. Annual compounded rates of over a million percent have been available in the past and this writer has lent at those rates. I provide evidence of that 1,000,000 % below.

At time of writing (20 May 2018) 50,000 Bitcoin with a value of $415 million are out on loan at Bitfinex at 0.01% Daily / 3.6% Annualised (compounded).

Lending USD

You can lend USD as well as Bitcoin to margin traders at Bitfinex. The exchange works like a bank In Real Life pumped on steroids. In Real Life saving rates average about 1% annually in the advanced economies of the OECD. (E.g. Japan 0.1%, Germany 0.1%, UK 1.9%, US 2.35%.) In the Bitcoin world annualised USD rates of 30%-100% are often available, particularly when the market is bullish. How is this possible? Traders at Bitfinex wishing to buy Bitcoin on leverage need to borrow USD to do so. It is the other users of the exchange who lend them these dollars. But USD is in short supply at Bitfinex when the Bitcoin market is optimistic because most users want to be holding Bitcoin not dollars to benefit from the price appreciation.

At time of writing USD with value $720 million are being lent out at Bitfinexat 0.065% Daily / 26% Annualised (compounded).

When the Bitcoin market is bullish then USD rates tend to exceed Bitcoin rates. (Margin traders need to borrow USD to finance their BTCUSD Longs.) When the market is bearish the BTC rate exceeds the USD rate as traders need to borrow Bitcoin to Short it.

Source BFXData.com. See how Rates on USD lending (Blue line) are lower in 2018 than in 2017 as result of bear Bitcoin market in 2018. A Daily rate of 0.1% equates to an annual compounded rate of 44%. Bitfinexed is like a savings bank on steroids.

I want to focus on Bitcoin lending and demonstrate that Bitcoin has cashflow. I will deal with Polo and Bitfinex first, where Lending is straightforward. Lending Bitcoin at BitMEX often offers the best rates, but it is a little tricky.

You can lend BTC to margin traders at Polo who are going Long on ALTBTC positions with leverage. (They need to borrow BTC to pay for the ALT positions.) There is no USD Lending market at Polo.

When Alts are pumping you will get a great Lending rate; rates will be modest when Altcoin markets are quiet of falling. Rates can go batshit when there is volatility incoming. A daily rate of 0.1593% seen in the table below is 79% compounded annualised.

Rates exploded in the run-up to the Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. The reason was every man and his dog moved their BTC off the exchanges into cold storage to ensure they received their Bitcoin Cash. So there was very little Supply of Bitcoin available for Lending.

Zooming out, we can see that pronounced effect of thr Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. (Data is from Bitfinex but the point stands.)

Source BFXData.com. See how Rates on BTC lending (Blue line) exploded at 1 August 2017. And see how BTC lending rate is highish in Feb and March 2018 as ascendant bears borrowed BTC to short. A Daily rate of 0.05% equates to an annual compounded rate of 20%.

How to earn this interest at Poloniex? It's easy. Move BTC to your Polo Lending Wallet and offer them for Loan under the Lending tab. You need to set an Amount, a Duration, and a Rate. Set a rate that is in line with the market as seen in Loan Offers . If you try for too high a rate your Offer will not get filled. You can ignore the Loan Demands table.

Lending is called Funding at Bitfinex. (And confusingly, Funding at Kraken means Deposits and Withdrawals.)

a. You can lend BTC to fund margin traders at Bitfinex who are going Long on ALTBTC positions with leverage.

b. Bitfinex also offers BTCUSD margin trading (unlike Polo) so you can lend BTC to those going Short on BTCUSD . (They need to possess BTC to sell it.)

c. You can also lend USD to traders going Long on BTCUSD and ALTUSD.

USD rates at Bitfinex tend to dwarf those available In Real Life.

You can currently earn a fortune lending USD at Bitfinex.

So, how to lend at Bitfinex? Again, it's easy. Move BTC or USD to your Funding Wallet. Then go to the Funding Tab and make your Loan Offers, setting an Amount, a Period and a Rate.

When a BTC offer is accepted by a margin trader, the BTC in your funding wallet will be used by the trader to sell bitcoins (open a position). When the trader completes a trade by closing the position, they buy BTC which is returned to your wallet.

Use the Auto-Renew feature to avoid a lot of donkey work. More info. on Funding at Bitfinex.

You can also lend ALTS at Bitfinex. (You lend them to margin traders shorting them.)

So at time of writing (20 May 2018) $720 million are being lent out at Daily 0.065% / 26% annualised, and 50,000 Bitcoin with value of $415 million at 0.01% Daily / 3.6% annualised.

Rates for Funding at BitMEX are often the highest in the crypto space. It is not so straightforward as lending at Poloniex and Bitfinex.

When net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bullish, you earn funding income by shorting the XBTUSD Swap contract. (Shorting Bitcoin essentially means you are holding a USD position.) This was the case for most of 2017.

When net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bearish, you earn funding by going Long the XBTUSD Swap. Ths has applied to most of 2018.

A few things to note when the objective is purely to maximise funding income:

How to find out if you should go Long or Short to get the Funding?

The Funding Rate for the current 8-hour Session is displayed in the Contract Details box bottom-left.

Hover over the box to see Predicted Funding Rate for next Session.

The Funding History page shows the history.

Interest is paid every 8 hour period, so 3 times a day. At 4am UTC then at midday UTC and then at 8PM UTC.

When you are shorting Bitcoin your position (Unrealised PNL) will change according to price of Bitcoin, until you close your short, at which point you will turn it into a Realised PNL. But your interest payments will be realised (Realised PNL) every 8 hours and come into your account.

Whe you are comfortable with shorting with 1x leverage, you can try 2x. Shorting on 2x allows you to keep some of your Bitcoin in cold storage, so you are exposed to less counterparty risk to BitMEX. Watch the market and add extra margin if the price gets near to your Liquidation price to avoid Liquidation.

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.

HandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through ""contactless"" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).

HandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: ""Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.""

HandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using ""handle"" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.

HandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy ""contactless"" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.

HandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: ""In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.""

nChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: ""For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.""

nChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes:

Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality.

The BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash's vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.

11,872194688,2018-05-21,17:35:00,2018-05-21T17:35:00Z,Bitcoin mining - How much energy is really consumed?,"The amount of electricity used in mining bitcoins is a subject that has been debated for several years, says economist Alex de Vries, who studies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. His study into the amount of energy being used to mine bitcoins is the first peer-reviewed research on the topic and was published in the scientific energy journal Joule. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were invented in 2008 by an anonymous computer programmer, and bitcoin mining refers to the work done by computers connected to the global Bitcoin network. We're not talking about just one or two computers, either, but thousands of them. According to the BBC, the computers solve complex mathematical problems that in turn, validate transactions between users of the cryptocurrency without the use of an intermediary. But in order to validate a transaction and prevent a duplication, a process known as ""proof-of-work"" is required, and this entails using an army of computers, all working at the same time. OK, if you are still with me, the bitcoins are exchanged along a public digital ledger called the blockchain. It is in the blockchain where all the complicated mathematical calculations, called ""hashes"" are made. And anyone wishing to join in and help in verifying the transactions can do so. They are rewarded with bitcoins. Basically, it is a complicated process and a lot of hard work. De Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are crunching about 26 quintillion hashes -- that's 26,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 -- every second of every day, reports CBC Canada. Use of electricity in bitcoin mining De Vries calculates that right now, the computers in the network, called ""miners,"" are consuming at least 2.5 gigawatts of power per year. However, by the end of this year, they will collectively be using three times that amount of electricity, or 7.5 gigawatts a year. ""The main problem is that the energy consumption primarily relates to how agreement on the underlying blockchain is reached,"" de Vries told Gizmodo. ""Mining makes it a big competitive lottery where the winner -- every 10 minutes -- gets to create the next block for the blockchain. The built-in reward for this process is fixed, so it motivates participants to constantly add new machines to the network to get a bigger slice of the pie -- the more computational power the more you win."" ""Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race, Roberto Frota Decourt, a cryptocurrency expert at the Unisinos Business School in Brazil who wasn't involved in the new study, told Gizmodo. ""The required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block -- and more zeros means more difficulty. The bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful."" Bitcoin mining a vicious cycle Basically, the whole bitcoin mining process has turned into a vicious cycle of more computer use and more energy requirements. And the process of mining has turned into a game, except the winners only get half of what the reward should be. And as the hashing get harder, it takes even more computations to create a block. And on top of that, Decourt points out that the bitcoin block mining reward gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks, so it actually takes twice the amount of computing time and energy to make the same amount of bitcoins. Not everyone believes De Vries is accurate in his assumptions on the energy being used to produce bitcoins, primarily because he has not taken into consideration competing cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. There are other ways to build cryptocurrencies, and they are gaining in popularity. Called proof-of-research and proof-of-stake, these transactions create less energy intensive coins. And then there is the advancement in technologies that make the machines used for mining bitcoins more efficient. So this leads to the very obvious question - Does bitcoin mining use too much electricity?",digitaljournal.com

Being a 'Bitcoin maximalist' may not be as crazy as you think. In the latest installment of its market research, Hong Kong based trading platform BitMEX identified 42 struggling tokens, which ""seem to have forked away from Bitcoin.""

All coming after the network's first hard fork, Bitcoin Cash, the list includes many tokens which failed to make the headlines, such as Bitcoin Hot, Bitcoin Faith, and even Bitcoin Pizza.

As Bitcoinist previously reported, Bitcoin hard forks generated significant publicity at the end of 2017, when commentators considered the phenomenon could become the next phase of the investment craze which started with ICOs earlier in the year.

Hard fork tokens' mainstream appeal then largely died out, however, with Litecoin's February hard fork gaining mixed reviews and creator Charlie Lee even branding the new token, dubbed Litecoin Cash, a ""scam.""

Commenting on its findings, BitMEX delivered a similar verdict, arguing the Bitcoin ecosystem had ""moved on"" from hard forks.

The research release coincides with a more informal review of altcoin markets gaining traction on social media.

Uploading a screenshot of cryptocurrency tracking site Coinmarketcap's top ten currencies from 2013, EY cryptocurrency lead Federico Tenga noted the majority of altcoins on the list had since de facto disappeared.

""...Let's see how many of current 'new generation blockchains' will still be around in 2023,"" he commented.

The list makes for curious reading as Litecoin is the only altcoin to remain in the top 10 with others relegated to the bottom of the charts like Namecoin, Peercoin and Novacoin.

The altcoins traded up to around $3.70 each, with Bitcoin at the time worth $123.

A crackdown on cryptocurrency-related scams is being coordinated by state regulators across the country, as con artists play up the popularity of Bitcoin.

Various enforcement actions, including some taken in provinces of Canada, have included cease and desist orders involving companies with names like Cryptocashback, Cryptosecure, DasCoin, ThinkCoin, Ubcoin, Leverage and Krios.

The North American Securities Administrators Association -- a group of state securities regulators who work to protect investors -- said Monday that 70 investigations have opened up relating to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency programs. There are 35 pending and completed enforcement actions nationwide since the beginning of May.

Millennials are viewed as potential targets, as consumers who are embracing financial technology-related products.

Regulators said millennials are both most likely to use fintech products (84%) and most at risk of fraud relating to some fintech schemes (41%), according to a survey released by the North American Securities Administrators Association in February.

ICOs and cryptocurrencies are viewed as high risks for fraud.

Initial coin offerings are fund-raising programs that could be used to kick off a new cryptocurrency effort. But some of the ICOs can be nothing but frauds where con artists keep the cash.

Even offerings that are legitimate should be viewed as highly risky.

""Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,"" said Joe Borg, president of the the North American Securities Administrators Association.

Why are people ponying up money after repeated warnings about the dangers of ICOs?

""People are afraid to miss out on the latest and the greatest,"" Borg said in a press conference on Monday in Washington, D.C.

Many times, retirees and others can fall for these schemes because they're trying to make up for lost time and rebuild underfunded nest eggs, said Borg, who is the Alabama Securities Commission Director.

Some consumers who never recovered from the stock market crash in 2008-09 can be lured into sending money -- even using digital currency -- on nothing but the promise of quick, sizable returns.

Regulators said ""Operation Cryptosweep"" has uncovered roughly 30,000 domain names relating to cryptotocurrency. Many were registered in the past year as the price of Bitcoin went bonkers.

Bitcoin -- which had been valued around $1,400 in early May 2017 -- rose above $19,000 by December.

Bitcoin has since dropped significantly in value to around $8,400 on May 21 but the buzz continues to build.

In some cases, fraudulent websites have used photos of popular personalities. The Texas State Securities Board shut down one initial coin offering site in early May that regulators claim used photos of Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities as part of fake endorsements.

Joe Rotunda, NASAA Enforcement Section vice chair and director of Enforcement for the Texas State Securities Board, said fraudsters often use false claims that a well-known public figure or a celebrity is associated with an initial offering as a way to encourage potential investors to send money.

One fraudulent effort, he said, even used a photo of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to sell cryptocurrency.

Some signs of a scam: Promoters promise lucrative returns tied to cryptocurrencies but manipulate photographs, possibly using stock photos available elsewhere online, in seemingly professional, polished presentations online.

Christopher Gerold, NASAA Enforcement section chair and New Jersey Securities bureau chief, said state regulators used some old-fashioned detective work, including undercover tactics, to try to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency schemes.

Gerold said most, if not all, promoters do not have the proper licenses for selling such investments.

14,872176783,2018-05-21,16:55:00,2018-05-21T16:55:00Z,Bitcoin extortion case: Complainant turns out to be kingpin,"AHMEDABAD: In a new twist in the country's first case of bitcoin extortion, the Gujarat Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has booked a Surat-based builder for allegedly extorting over ₹155 crore in cash and bitcoins from two persons.

Earlier, the builder and realtor, Shailesh Bhatt, was the complainant in a bitcoin extortion case in which bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were extorted from him by the Amreli police. The police have arrested Amreli Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel while a former BJP legislator Nalin Kotadia is on the run.

In his complaint, Mr. Bhatt had alleged that some Amreli policemen extorted ""bitcoins worth ₹9 crore"" from him four months back when he was abducted and beaten by the cops.

""While probing the case, we learnt that Mr Bhatt himself was an extortionist, as he had extorted bitcoins worth ₹155 from others before he himself became a victim when he was kidnapped by the Amreli police,"" CID (Crime) chief Ashish Bhatia told reporters on Monday when he announced lodging of a new case to book the complainant and others.

""Around two years ago, one Satish Kumbhani of Surat floated a company called Bit Connect and lured people like Bhatt to invest in it to get huge returns in a short time. Bhatt had invested ₹2 crore in it. However, its promoters shut shop in January this year and went underground,"" said Mr. Bhatia.

To recover his investment, Mr. Bhatt's accomplices first kidnapped Piyush Savalia by posing as Income Tax officials, as Mr. Savalia used to work for that company. Mr. Savalia was confined in a farm house at gun-point for three days in January-end.

""On February 1, Bhatt's men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gun-point, as the latter was also attached with the bankrupt firm. Bhatt's accomplices forced Mavani to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth ₹131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth ₹9.64 crore into their account,"" Mr. Bhatia said, sharing details of how Mr. Bhatt and his aides were running an underworld type extortion racket in Surat where people turned to virtual currencies to convert their black money during and after demonetisation.

To set Mr. Mavani free, Bhatt and his accomplices also extorted ₹14.50 crore cash, which the builder received through the 'Angadia' service (an unofficial cash courier service), he said.

""Bhatt and his accomplices extorted bitcoins and cash worth a total of ₹155.21 crore. Later, they distributed the bitcoins among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 bitcoins,"" the CID official said.

Since Mr. Bhatt was not tech-ssavvy, he took the help of his nephew Nikunj Bhatt to transfer those bitcoins into his virtual wallet. The CID (crime) has arrested Nikunj.

The entire conspiracy was unearthed when Mr. Savalia was questioned by the CID recently after the arrest of Amreli SP and Police Inspector Anant Patel and Mr. Bhatt's business partner Kirit Paladia.

Mr Bhatia added that the bitcoin extortion racket was set to get bigger as more people who invested in the hope of making quick bucks became victims of organised racket.",thehindu.com
15,872176307,2018-05-21,16:55:00,2018-05-21T16:55:00Z,"Bitcoin, Vollgeld, and popular views of money","On 10 June 2018, Switzerland will be the first country to have a referendum on the introduction of Sovereign Money ('Vollgeld'). This column argues that the Vollgeld project and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin build on popular fantasies about money that are disconnected from the actual operation of the current monetary system. Unfortunately, the latter's features remain underexplored even among economists.

Money being one of the key symbols of the current economic system, and the monetary and the financial system being a key site of the Global Crisis, the idea that there is something wrong with money is one of the most popular explanations for the crisis among non-economists.

The desire to 'put money right' by introducing Bitcoin, Sovereign Money (or 'Vollgeld') or regional currency schemes is a result of this perception.

Among other issues, these initiatives revive two major age-old debates at the heart of monetary theory and history:

The vision for an alternative currency underlying Bitcoin and similar crypto projects is based on replacing a central issuing entity by an automaton embedded in a technical architecture providing market incentives for economic subjects to animate and use it. Most cryptocurrencies are pure assets governed for the most part by market forces (Huberman et al. 2017, Fatas and Weder di Mauro 2018).

Sovereign Money is based on the view that money should be a pure asset, and that the creation of means of payment, subject to strict quantity control, is a prerogative of the state (Bacchetta 2018).

Both have received the greatest public attention so far among monetary reform projects. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have experienced headline-grabbing price movements in recent months. And a citizens' movement in Switzerland has managed to enforce a plebiscite on the introduction of Sovereign Money to be held on 10 June 2018.

The liquidity provided by money is a form of insurance against uncertainty, as long as the purchasing power of the currency concerned follows a stable pattern over time. At the cost of renouncing either the higher returns offered by riskier assets or the joys of consumption, money can be held without committing to a specific time, contract party, or commodity to spend it on.

When money is a claim on an issuer, it is obvious that holding it puts you in a relationship with this issuer that involves trust issues. The instability triggered by the Global Crisis resulted in an increased desire among economic subjects to hold liquidity, and trust issues involved in financial affairs became the centre of public attention (Jobst and Stix 2017). While money has remained stable (in terms of general acceptance and purchasing power) in major currency areas in a context where many other financial instruments did not, the difference is not always acknowledged among observers.

In this context, projects like Bitcoin and Sovereign Money attract attention by suggesting that money is not safe unless it ceases to be a claim on an issuer. Instead, it should become a pure asset and be put under strict quantity control. Neglecting the inevitable dependence on others involved in holding money or any other non-consumable asset, the underlying idea is that commodity-like money would enable individual possession of money without dependence on an issuer which may suddenly become unable to make good on its promise.

Both concepts share the idea that controlling the quantity of money is key for securing a currency's value, whereas the process of issuing it is considered of negligible importance. Therefore, both use the creation of new currency units to subsidise economic activities they consider useful.

The rule for receiving new bitcoins is dubbed 'proof of work' - miners obtain rewards from the issuing automaton for having contributed to the administration of Bitcoin's payment system.

Because Sovereign Money is to be issued primarily as a donation to either the state or all its individual citizens, we could label its money-issuing rule 'proof of status'.

They differ with respect to the preferred entity to exert the desired quantity control. In Bitcoin and similar projects, technology (i.e. rules encoded in an open-source software) is administering a transparent supply rule for digital units designed to attract decentralized activity. Under Sovereign Money, a state entity has the exclusive right to issue means of payments in official currency in order to control the money supply.

A key reason for the popularity of both Bitcoin and Sovereign Money lies in the compatibility of their idea of money with a widely held perception among the general public (Mehrling 2015). Widespread ideas of sound money and its creation centre on a fixed homogeneous stock based on centralised quantity control. The crisis has shown that this view is at odds with the balance sheet-based realities of contemporary money and finance, their fragility and flexibility. Popular support for monetary reform projects can be considered one result of this. Unfortunately, much of current economics does not pay much attention to offering economists tools to address these issues (Goodhart 2018).

With respect to the two major debates in monetary theory referred to above, the current monetary system is a hybrid arrangement. It is based on the historical integration of sovereign coin-based with private accounting-based systems of issuing means of payment. Within each currency area, it combines both decentralised (i.e. market competition) and centralised governance mechanisms.

Today, new means of payment are created when an issuer swaps liabilities with a debtor based on terms and conditions set by the issuer. The monetary system consists of several issuers creating means of payment that form a hierarchical relation of claims under the common roof of a single unit of account.

Means of payment issued by commercial banks are created against contractual payment commitments of a debtor or a third party (i.e. securities). Liabilities of commercial banks serving as means of payment for users are claims on cash issued by the central bank. A key function of banks is to offer liquidity to deposit owners operating with a small cash reserve, while a major part of the asset side of their balance sheet is committed to credit claims. Banks' issuing behaviour is governed by profitability and risk concerns, subject to competition, regulation, supervision, and monetary policy.

The monetary system consists of a hierarchy of issuers, with means of payment issued by lower-ranking issuers being claims on higher ranks in the hierarchy. The top of the hierarchy in any currency area is central bank-issued money, serving as the final means of payment.

Because of its status as the exclusive means to settle tax obligations, official currency may be considered a form of claim on the state. More narrowly, cash and deposits of commercial banks at the central bank are the latter's liability. Under current flexible exchange rate arrangements, these liabilities are usually not redeemable for users against assets held as counterpart on the central bank's balance sheet. That gives them some features of a pure asset for the user. But it does not suspend the basic principle that new money is issued only against a counterpart asset that is subsequently held on the central bank's balance sheet, based on terms and conditions set in view of a public mandate. Money creation is not unilateral wealth creation. Instead, it consists of swapping a new means of payment against a claim on future payments.

Making creditworthiness of counterparties a key criterion for issuing new means of payments establishes an important principle: new money only enters the economy when its initial user has extended a convincing promise to pay it back, or hands over the promise to pay by a third party (i.e. a security). Such contractual commitments of future income support the expectation behind the general acceptance of a currency and money's stable purchasing power that future economic activity will take place resulting in goods and services available for money.

Economic models based on abstracting from these institutional details inadequately prepare economists to address a number of key concerns in current public debate.

Money creation can be understood as being based on 'proof of creditworthiness'. In contrast, issuing a 'currency' as a pure asset against either 'proof of work' (Bitcoin) or 'proof of status' (Vollgeld) severs the link between the creation of means of payments and commitments to contribute to future economic activity. Whether such an asset would be considered by potential users as a currency, a worthless token best avoided, or a kind of collector's item inviting speculative activity is an open question. Over the last ten years, crypto users' focus of activity (i.e. speculative activity) has already provided us with a clear answer on the status of Bitcoin and similar projects. Whether Swiss citizens are attracted by the invitation to subject their official currency to an experiment remains to be seen.

An economist at one of the world's largest asset managers believes there is a ""decent probability"" that the bitcoin price will eventually crash to zero.

Joe Davis, the chief economist for $5.1 trillion asset manager Vanguard, wrote in an ETF.com op-ed that although the firm is enthusiastic about blockchain technology in general, it does not believe cryptocurrencies constitute a viable use case.""

""I'm enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.""

Davis argued that bitcoin should not be classified as money, because although it could qualify as a unit of account and medium of exchange it is not an effective store of value. Moreover, he said that its current valuation is based purely on speculation rather than economic fundamentals.

He wrote:

""The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.""

He further warned investors against allocating even a small percentage of their assets to bitcoin, as this will reduce their exposure to ""tried and true asset classes"" in favor of an asset class whose investment case is ""hardly compelling.""

""As innovation quickens and competition increases, the majority of networks (and their associated cryptocurrencies) may be rendered obsolete, leaving many cryptocurrencies like tulip bulbs in 17th-century Holland -- soaring to incredible heights before the speculative bubble pops,"" he said, parroting a common-but-dubious analogy. ""And, unlike tulips, they don't look very nice in a vase.""

Davis isn't the first Vanguard executive to disparage bitcoin as an investment and cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Last year, Vanguard Group founder John Bogle advised investors to ""avoid bitcoin like the plague"" since it has no underlying rate of return. ""When it gets back to $100, we'll talk,"" he said.

Other asset managers, however, are beginning to warm to the nascent cryptocurrency industry. Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin trading operation, and even JPMorgan -- whose CEO, Jamie Dimon, has long been one of bitcoin's most outspoken opponents -- may soon help its clients invest in cryptocurrency.",ccn.com
17,b-872212306,2018-05-21,15:28:00,2018-05-21T15:28:00Z, SoK Cryptocurrencies and the Bitcoin Lightning Network,"We wrapped up the distributed systems seminar with two more papers discussed last month.

The ""SoK: Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies"" paper appeared in 2015. Although the cryptocurrency scene has seen a lot of action recently, this survey paper did not age and it is still a very good introduction to learning about the technical aspects and challenges of cryptocurrencies. The paper starts with a technical overview of the cryptocurrency concept. Then it delves more into incentives and stability issues. It observes that it is unclear ""how stability will be affected either in the end state of no mining rewards or in intermediate states as transaction fees become a non-negligible source of revenue"". It talks about possible attacks, including Goldfinger attack and feather-forking, and also about stability of mining pools and the peer-to-peer layer. Finally it also covers some security and privacy issues.

""The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments"" whitepaper is from 2016. Bitcoin has a very high latency, poor scalability, and high transaction fees, and the lightning network provides an overlay solution to ease off these pains. To this end, the paper describes a secure off-chain solution for instant payments and microtransactions with low transaction fee. This video by Jackson Palmer describes the lightning network ideas very nicely. (I strongly prefer reading to watching/listening, but recently I am finding a lot of useful content on YouTube.)

The protocol builds on the basic concept of a pairwise payment channel. Two parties put aside an initial amount of Bitcoin into a multi signature transaction. Subsequently many updates to the allocation of the current balance can be made off-the-chain just with the cooperation of both parties using a new timelocked transaction, without broadcasting this to the chain. This is analogous to buying a Starbucks card and transacting with Starbucks pairwise with that card. A broadcast to the chain can be done to redeem funds on the chain and to close the channel. If either party tries to cheat by broadcasting an old transaction state from the pairwise payment channel, the counterparty may take all the funds in the channel as penalty after it provides the latest multisig agreed state to the chain (within the on-chain dispute mediation window).

The lightning overlay network is then formed by multihop routing over these pairwise payment channels. Even when A and Z does not have a direct pairwise payment channel, it may be possible to construct a multihop route from A to Z to use intermediaries, traversing through several pairwise payment channels. While pairwise channels could be without a fee, the multihop intermediaries need a small transaction fee to have the incentive to participate.

The pairwise payment channels need to be extend with hashlocks to achieve multihop transactions. Here is how this is done as explained in the Bitcoin wiki:

In order for the multihop routes to work there should be enough cooperative participants online, each of which with enough balance to pass the bucket from hand to hand. The rest is a path-finding exercise. With viable paths present, similar to a source-side routing decision, you can start the lightning transaction. There has been a lot of work on MANETs under the names of intermittently connected networks and delay tolerant routing. I wonder if some of them can find applications here (even though they were mostly geometrical and this is a non-geometrical network.) In practice though, the multihop network often converges to a hub and spokes model, with a well-connected fat wallet intermediary.

The lightning network is also useful for transacting securely across different blockchains, as long as all edges in the route support the same hash function to use for the hash lock and can create timed locks.

1. How can we improve the way we run the seminar?

The students liked how we run the seminars. They said they were more actively engaged and learned a greater deal due to this format. But I think we can improve. It would be nice to get experts video-conference and answer some questions. I think many experts would be generous to spare 20 minutes to spare to answer some questions from smart well-prepared students.

The students also mentioned that it would have been nice to have some hands-on projects to accompany the seminars. We started a blockchain channel so the interested students can figure out some small projects they can work on and collaborate.

2. What did I learn?

I didn't think much of blockchains but I am fascinated to learn that there are many challenging questions here and many good ideas/techniques. This is an area very suitable for doing distributed algorithms/protocols work, which I love. There is a need for developing more principled approaches and well-reasoned and verified algorithms/protocols.

I still think the best ideas from these work will get borrowed and used in more centralized (could be hierarchical or federated) systems for the sake of efficiency/economy and scalability. That may be how these systems will go mainstream to millions and even billions.",muratbuffalo.blogspot.si
18,872121290,2018-05-21,15:01:00,2018-05-21T15:01:00Z,Bitcoin Took a Hit Last Week But These Cryptos Fared Worse - CoinDesk,"Bitcoin hogged the limelight in the cryptocurrency markets last week as it fell to one-month lows below $8,000.

Yet, while the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization suffered a 3.6 percent week-on-week drop in prices, it still outclassed other major names like bitcoin cash (BCH) and EOS, which both reported double-digit losses.

Meanwhile, the previous week's winner zilliqa (ZIL) fell almost 20 percent to become the biggest loser among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

On the plus side, privacy-focused zcash rallied 50 percent and topped the list of winners as investors cheered a new exchange listing.

Zilliqa dropped close to 20 percent in the week ended May 18, having rallied 13.8 percent in the previous week. However, the cryptocurrency was overdue for a healthy correction after a solid rally to record high of $0.2306 on May 10.

While the investor community is keenly eyeing a Singapore meetup at which the zilliqa developers will give a preview of its new smart contract language Scilla, the pre-event excitement has not put a bid under the token.

A break below the May 18 low of 0.00001608 BTC would establish a lower highs and lower lows (bearish setup) pattern and allow a deeper drop to 0.00001430 BTC (50 percent Fibonacci retracement). The 10-day moving average is trending south in favor of the bears.

EOS fell to three-week lows below $12 last week, according to Bitfinex, indicating the excitement surrounding the coming mainnet launch is no longer boosting its price. However, the cryptocurrency did defend the 50-day moving average (MA) and moved back above $13.00 as seen in the chart below.

Notably, the ascending trendline (in red) is still intact, and EOS is trading well above the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting the long-run technical outlook remains bullish.

A high volume break above the descending trendline resistance, currently at $15.62, would allow a re-test of record highs around $23.00. On the downside, acceptance below the rising trendline would signal a bearish trend reversal - i.e. the rally from the March 18 low of $3.87 has ended.

Bitcoin cash (BCH) ran into offers around $1,500 on May 13/14 and fell to a low of $1,128 on Bitfinex on Friday - the lowest level since April 22.

A planned software upgrade (or hard fork) to introduce new features came into effect on May 15 as expected, but around 20 percent of nodes have still not upgraded - perhaps negating any potential price boost from the news.

Subsequently, the weekend's rally in bitcoin prices seems to have had a positive impact and BCH did regain bid tone, but it failed to cut through the key moving average, as seen in the chart below.

BCH is now back below the head-and-shoulders neckline, having faced rejection at the descending (bearish) 50-candle moving average hurdle. As a result, the recent low of $1,128 could again be put to test.

A daily close below that level would mean the rally from the April low of $600 has ended and could yield a drop to levels below the $1,000 mark.

However, a move above $1,500 (last week's high) would put the bulls back in the driver's seat.

20,872106648,2018-05-21,14:35:00,2018-05-21T14:35:00Z,Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Files for Hong Kong IPO - CoinDesk,"Canaan Creative, one of the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining chips and devices, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX).

Filed on May 15, the firm's application is still in draft form and pending approval from the HKEX, so it remains unknown at this stage how much the China-based company is valued at and what figure it intends to raise.

However, a report from Bloomberg suggests that the firm aims to raise $1 billion, which, if true and ultimately successful, would make it the largest ever IPO in the cryptocurrency industry.

Meanwhile, the document also offers a glimpse into the firm's financial health. According to a financial statement included as part of the IPO filing, Canaan raised 1.3 billion yuan ($204 million) in revenue in 2017 alone, marking 3,000 percent year-on-year growth compared with 2016.

Similarly, the firm also brought in a net profit of $56 million in 2017 - a six-fold increase over the previous year.

This isn't the first time that the bitcoin miner maker has closed on becoming a publicly traded entity. As previously reported by CoinDesk, an attempted acquisition deal in 2016 would have seen Canaan go public on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, but the stock exchange eventually blocked the move over ""uncertainties.""

In May 2017, the company raised 300 million yuan ($43 million at the time) in a Series A round that saw the participation of Jin Jiang International Group, Baopu Asset Management and Tunlan Investment.

On May 19, a group of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) miners met after the Coingeek Conference in Hong Kong to discuss a new proposal which would fund BCH development and professional programmers who worked on the protocol. The funding would stem from a portion of the miners block reward, and attendees discussed donating between 1-5 percent of rewards to fund developers. Technical picture on Bitcoin looks neutral to bearish.

Trading recommendations:

According to the H1 time - frame, I found that the price rejected from the upper diagonal of the channel, which is a sign that buying at this stage looks risky. I also found possible bearish flag in creation, which is a sign of weakness. My advice is to watch for a potential breakout of the bearis flag to confirm further downward price and potential re-test of $8.355 (lower diagonal).

Prior to the 1970s, cryptography was primarily used for secret military or espionage purposes. However, over time and following various legal challenges, such secret information gradually crept into the public domain with open source encryption software code becoming more widely available. In the late 1980s/early 1990s, the ""cypherpunk"" movement was born in San Francisco with the primary objective of developing and exchanging ideas on privacy enhancing technology in an increasingly digital age (which is particularly prescient given current debates on such issues). Out of the cypherpunk movement and following several earlier attempts at creating digital money by members of the cypherpunk movement, bitcoin was born on 31 October 2008 with the publication of the bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakomoto (a probable pseudonym for a, as yet unidentified, developer or group of developers) and released as open source software code in 2009. Through the creation of bitcoin, which for the first time created a platform where trust is achieved through network consensus and verification (rather than being reliant on a third party) and money could be transferred digitally without being copied or ""double spent"", Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain technology. Pandora's box was quietly opened.

It is not a coincidence that bitcoin's genesis was in the midst of the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. With a perceived lack of faith in the existing banking sector, bitcoin created a new, immutable and completely decentralised peer-to-peer payment network that does not need banks, intermediaries or centralised infrastructure of any kind to work. Whilst central banks across the US and Europe embarked upon quantitative easing programmes, effectively printing money to alleviate the crisis, bitcoin was purposely designed as deflationary in nature with a fixed supply cap of 21 million bitcoins (as much as 4 million of which are widely believed to have been lost forever). This element of scarcity of supply, combined with the anti-fragile and immutable nature of the blockchain technology, has led many to believe that, in the long term, bitcoin may be superior to, and more robust than, traditional ""fiat"" currency as a unit of account, store of value and medium of exchange.

As bitcoin is open source and, due to its decentralised nature, is not protected by any intellectual property rights, alternative cryptocurrencies (so called ""alt-coins""), usually based upon a modification or ""fork"" of the original Satoshi blockchain, have flourished. Some have questioned whether this ability to create alt-coins dilutes the scarcity of supply of bitcoin. However, although certain currently popular alt-coins may have certain qualities or functions that, at the moment, bitcoin is perceived as lacking e.g. Litecoin (fast transaction speed), Ethereum (smart contracts, creation of new ICOs), Monero (privacy) and Ripple (use for bank to bank transactions), bitcoin remains at present the most secure, tested and truly decentralised network, with the most development being carried out on it. In addition, the network effect of bitcoin and the recent increase in interest from institutional investors means that bitcoin is likely to retain its market dominance in the space for some years to come.

In 2017, there was also an enormous rise in, what are termed, initial coin offerings ('ICOs'). An ICO is a fund raising exercise whereby crypto tokens on a blockchain (usually Ethereum) are issued to investors and then tradeable on cryptocurrency exchanges. There are two main types of tokens: i) utility tokens, which have a payment function and represent future access to a company's goods and services (which may not yet be developed); and (ii) security tokens which provide its holder with a right derived from an underlying financial asset. Whilst security tokens are largely regulated by existing laws regulating securities, utility tokens are not, despite being acquired and traded mostly for purely speculative purposes rather than their future utility potential.

This gap has been exploited by a large number of ""pump and dump"" style scams in recent times. Supposed utility tokens, with little or no future potential use case, have been pumped through online forums by its founders and insiders who then sell their tokens on the wave of an initial, short lived meteoric rise in price on cryptoexchanges, which then crashes never to return, leaving, in many cases, the second wave of investors holding virtually useless and worthless tokens. It is not dissimilar to the penny stock pump and dump schemes of the late 80s/early 90s as shown in the film The Wolf of Wall Street. There are also echoes of the late 90s dotcom bubble with projects having little or no utility potential being speculated upon just because it had a name associated with the tech boom - just substitute the word ""dotcom"" for ""blockchain"". Historically, technology generally outpaces regulation. However, there will inevitably be a regulatory crackdown globally on such market manipulation through such schemes, which has already begun.

However, although there are a large number of bad actors in the ICO space, as the market matures and regulation improves, genuinely useful, bone fide and successful projects are likely to emerge. In particular, the proliferation and adoption of asset-backed tokenisation may be a growth area in the future. Just as bitcoin has digitised cash, other asset classes may also be digitised by appending a highly divisible, digital representation of the relevant asset to the blockchain - eliminating much of the friction and third party costs associated with holding, storing and transacting such assets and increasing their liquidity. This could lead, for example, to the issuing of tokens that represent a company's stock or real estate assets.

Blockchain technology is evolving at a very fast rate and into many different, complex forms. However, one key distinction to grasp is the difference between a public and a private blockchain.

The original bitcoin blockchain is a public blockchain. It is truly public and open ended in that anyone can participate without permission. It is decentralised and self-governed through network consensus and validation (most commonly proof of work consensus algorithms or ""mining""). The transactions carried out on it are transparent and publicly accessible. It is also described as a ""censorship resistant"" blockchain.

Conversely, a private blockchain (also sometimes referred to as a ""permissioned"" blockchain) is a closed system whereby permission is required for a person to participate. A person or group of persons control the network by writing and verifying each transaction. They usually do not involve any proof or work element. Many purists do not consider private blockchains to be true blockchains and consider them merely to be large databases that just use cryptography to secure them. However, they are generally faster and more efficient than a public blockchain and more suited to traditional companies and governments. One such government use of private blockchains is with land registries (as discussed below). Some countries such as Sweden and Georgia have already implemented blockchain technology with their land registries and Dubai has also announced its intention to similarly do so.

As with most jurisdictions across the world, the legal and regulatory framework in the UAE concerning cryptocurrency related matters is very much a work in progress and is a fluid and fast evolving area beyond the scope of this article.

There have been recent media reports of some developers in Dubai offering off-plan apartments for sale in exchange for bitcoin or offering discounts if payment is made in cryptocurrency. This appears to be more of a marketing ploy by such developers. To offset the volatility risk, we would assume that such apartments have a set price in UAE dirhams for which an equivalent value in bitcoins (or a combination of cash and bitcoins) may be paid. It is likely that the developer would then immediately upon receipt of such bitcoins convert the value into fiat currency.

Bitcoin is still very much at the early adopter stage of its development and mainstream use for transactional purposes has yet to materialise. The scalability of the blockchain has always been a problematic issue for widespread, high volume and fast transactional use (although this may be significantly improved through developments such as the ""Lightning Network"" or other ""off chain"" solutions layered on top of the bitcoin protocol and which are due to be rolled out very soon). Most cryptocurrency is held at the moment for purely speculative purposes, although such property deals may hold some attraction to long term holders of bitcoin who have amassed a large number of coins in the very early stages of its development when the price was very low and now wish to convert such coins into a more traditional asset class.

Payment of the purchase price in cryptocurrency would not work in Dubai in the secondary sales market. The Dubai Land Department would not currently accept this as a method of payment in order to transfer property. The legality of such offers is also uncertain.

Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies and blockchain have the potential to have a significant, disruptive effect on the real estate industry in the next 5 to 10 years.

Land registries

Most land registry systems across the world remain paper-based, although many countries are making the transition to recording the ownership of land online. The United Kingdom for example now stores all records online on the HM Land Registry database, but there are still vast amounts of paper such as original deeds and correspondence involved.

This process involves all documents being manually checked before the information is uploaded to the database, resulting in some information being missed or incorrectly inputted resulting in a delay in the transaction being registered and visible online.

The use of private, permissioned blockchains by land registries has the potential to reduce some of these difficulties. The benefit of a blockchain system is in creating a secure, immutable database that records the details of current and historic property ownership, dealings and encumbrances. The conveyancing process could also be significantly streamlined with the in-built trust mechanisms of blockchain and use of smart contracts removing the need for escrow arrangements and allowing for instantaneous and simultaneous processes relating to purchaser payment, title transfer and mortgage discharge. It also has the potential to significantly reduce the level of government costs and resources involved.

The use of blockchain in land registries also has the potential to significantly reduce the scope for fraud as the information on a blockchain cannot be tampered with and its transparency means that all parties with permission to use the ledger can check the information in it. This could be particularly useful for countries in the developing world where the land registration system is not secure and is open to corruption and manipulation. However, although the relevant software may be available, it is only as good as the information that is inputted on to it and any such process needs to be very carefully managed.

Dubai has announced its intentions to be the first blockchain powered government and be a leading centre for blockchain development. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy was announced in late 2016 and built upon the three pillars of:

As part of this strategy, the Dubai Land Department ('DLD') is in the process of migrating its land records to a blockchain based system and developing systems to simplify the overall property transaction process.

Tokenisation of real estate assets

The idea of tokenisation is the process of converting rights to a real world asset into a digital token on a blockchain which can be traded like a cryptocurrency on a digital exchange.

Real estate assets are, by their very nature, illiquid, non-fungible assets. Sale and purchase transactions take time to complete and there are a number of set processes that need to be carried out in order to complete the transaction by various third parties and intermediaries with associated transaction costs. Asset backed tokenisation has the potential to reduce these liquidity obstacles.

Publicly listed Real Estate Investment Trusts ('REITs') already provide a degree of liquidity for real estate investors. However, with a token, it has been speculated that this liquidity could be even further increased with: even smaller financial barriers to entry with tokens that can be divided into much smaller units (such as bitcoin where each coin is subdivided into one hundred million, tradeable units called ""satoshis""); the ability to tokenise an individual real estate asset (rather than having a basket of assets as with a REIT); and providing a cryptomarket place that is always open at any time of any day in any place in the world (traditional markets only trade during certain times on weekdays and are tied to a geographical location). Such liquidity has the potential to enhance the value of the underlying real estate asset by way of a liquidity premium as it mitigates the risk of not being able to sell the assets quickly if, for example, there was a sudden dip in the market.

Fractional and proportional ownership is one of the more interesting potential applications for real estate. For example, token ownership of a multi-let commercial property could give the token holder fractional ownership of the property and a proportionate right to rental income and the proceeds of sale upon disposal. As blockchain also functions as a ledger, and through the use of smart contracts, the token itself could potentially also contain in-built title and other key information about the property and its performance or governance mechanisms with voting rights regarding the management of a particular building.

If such tokenisation materialises as a widely adopted structure in the future, it is probably more suitable for commercial property and it is also likely that we would first see it developing alongside multi-layered, traditional ownership structures with fund or REIT ownership stakes being tokenised (rather than the direct ownership of the real estate asset with individual buildings going public).

In addition, the legal and regulatory approach of governments and relevant authorities to any such new types of proposed ownership structures are likely to take a long time to evolve particularly in areas such as AML/KYC requirements, consumer protection, taxation and transfer fees and foreign ownership considerations.

It is clear that a significant paradigm shift is underway with the proliferation of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology likely to have a transformative effect on a wide range of industries, such as real estate. Although the technology is advancing with breakneck speed, it will take time for legal and regulatory frameworks to develop and catch up. One difficulty is that cryptocurrency seems to be an entirely new, non-correlated form of asset class - whilst it simultaneously exhibits characteristics of currency, securities and commodities, placing it into just one of such categories creates challenges.

The common perception of cryptocurrency as being used for illicit or nefarious purposes (such as with its early connections with the dark web and the Silk Road online platform) is looking increasingly outdated. There have been some clear signs of increased mainstream acceptance internationally such as: the Goldman Sachs backed start up, Circle, recently purchasing the US cryptocurrency exchange, Poloniex; bitcoin futures launching on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; some largely positive messages coming out of the US from the relevant regulatory authorities (except in relation to utility token ICOs); government recognition of cryptocurrency as a means of payment in Japan; and, in the UAE, the DMCC freezone introducing the licensed activity of ""proprietary trading in crypto-commodities"". Like it or not, its increased use and acceptance seems inevitable. However, the exact form and shape of how the space will develop remains a very open question.",mondaq.com

Bitcoin has experienced a downward price trend since 5 May, when it looked set to break above the $10,000 price point. The last time its value was above that figure was March.

Despite the recent price falls, predictions for bitcoin continue to be positive, particularly from those within the cryptocurrency space.

You do not have access to view this Atom.

Most recently, analysts claimed that the price of bitcoin would rally during the annual Consensus conference, which took place in New York last week.

Typically, positive news coming out of Consensus results in a price boost for the cryptocurrency, however this year bitcoin finished the week around $800 down from its value at the start of the week.

This was reflected across all major cryptocurrencies, with the markets falling an average of 10 per cent during the week of Consensus.

Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said before the conference that he expected bitcoin's rally to be ""even larger than past years,"" however was forced to backtrack in an analysis report posted to Twitter.

He blamed the lack of a price rally on a lack of regulatory clarity but still remained optimistic about bitcoin's outlook.

""Bottom line: While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference,"" Mr Lee said.

Other positive predictions from cryptocurrency experts include the views of the investor and self-described ""bitcoin evangelist"" Alistair Milne, who believes bitcoin will reach between $35,000 and $60,000 by 2020.

Celebrated investor Tim Draper also revealed his prediction last month that bitcoin will soar to $250,000 by 2022 - a price increase that would see bitcoin's market capitalisation increase five-fold to around $5 trillion.

Widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Thomas Lee's short-term market forecast may not have materialized, but he's sticking with his bullish long-term prediction despite the setback. If anything, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Lee is digging in his heels even further, reportedly reiterating his forecast for a $25,000 BTC price by year-end.

Lee placed a great deal of stock in last week's Consensus conference, having said that a combination of a ""sanity check"" among market participants that innovation on the blockchain isn't slowing down coupled with ""new interest"" should have been a catalyst for market gains. Instead, the broader cryptocurrency market shed about 10%. He told CNBC: ""Clearly, we were too optimistic.""

Lee's predictions till now have been unfolding like clockwork, including the tax-selling pressure that he rightly called was weighing on the bitcoin price through much of the first quarter of 2018. But perhaps it was too high an expectation to put on any conference, despite the strong turnout.

Last week's blockchain extravaganza was a single event that most assuredly stirred curiosity about the market among newcomers, if only for the Lamborghinis that were parked outside in Midtown Manhattan. But that doesn't necessarily mean that investors will or should make any sudden decisions to invest. If anything, perhaps attendees are researching cryptocurrencies further now that the market is on their radar and they understand it better.

What Fundstrat's Lee apparently didn't factor in, however, was the reticence on the part of institutional investors to enter a market whose regulatory clarity is murky. It's not that he anticipated a fully regulatory framework by Consensus, but he admitted on CNBC the regulatory tilt was slightly negative.

""Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions. But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions,"" according to Lee.

Hindsight, of course, is always 20/20, and Fundstrat's Lee looking forward. But he says that ""it's going to take time"" for key developments to unfold, which in addition to more regulatory clarity includes greater custodial support before the institutional capital will come off the sidelines. Consensus, despite its ability to rally the markets, ""was a success,"" he said, and it did reveal some custodial partnerships, such as Japanese bank Nomura taking on the role as custodian.

Fundsrat's famous Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI), which reflects the way that people are emotionally feeling about the leading cryptocurrency, currently hovers at about 30 on a scale of 1-100, which Lee says ""is good news"" because only last month it was at 18. Fundstrat actually tracks 16 cryptocurrencies in that index, and bitcoin's score is the lowest among them while EOS is at the highest emotional level.

Lee is ""absolutely"" sticking to his outlook for $25,000 bitcoin by year-end, saying: ""We have to keep in mind ... bitcoin at $8,000 and bitcoin at $25,000 .... it doesn't require bitcoin to go up every day till the end of the year,"" he told CNBC.

Indeed, as Lee has pointed out previously, bitcoin historically achieves all of its gains across the 10 top trading days of the year.",ccn.com

Bitcoin Cash rallied 10.1% on Sunday, more than reversing Saturday's 2.29% fall, to end the day at $1,205.7.

Following a steady start to the day that saw Bitcoin Cash take a minor fall to an intraday low $1,163.4, holding well above the day's first major support level at $1,141.87, a morning rally saw Bitcoin Cash break through the day's first major resistance level at $1,214.57 with relative ease to $1,250.5, coming within reach of the day's second major resistance level at $1,252.63.

For the market bulls, Bitcoin Cash's hold above the first major resistance level through the morning supported an afternoon rally that saw Bitcoin Cash break through the second major resistance level at $1,252.63 to an intraday high $1,312.6.

While the day's high fell short of the third major resistance level at $1,325.33, selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,298 saw Bitcoin Cash pullback to sub-$1,300 levels by the day's end.

In spite of the day's rally, failing to move clear of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level continues to support the near-term bearish trend.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 1.19% to $1,277.1, recovering from an early $1,257 low, with Bitcoin Cash facing plenty of resistance at $1,300, a morning high $1,304.9 failing to hold and more importantly, move clear of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $1,298.

For the day ahead, with the weekend rally having provided some solid gains, Bitcoin Cash could be under pressure through the start of the week, investors continuing to be bearish in spite of double digit gains on Sunday.

A move back through to $1,300 levels would support a run at the day's first major resistance level at $1,351.07, breaking free of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level key for any sustainable rally through the day.

Failure to move back through to $1,300 levels to test the day's first major resistance level will likely see Bitcoin Cash give up some of Sunday's gains, bringing the day's first major support level at $1,141.87 into play, though we would expect Bitcoin Cash to avoid ending the day at sub-$1,200 levels, barring materially negative news hitting the wires.

Litecoin Looking to Consolidate

Litecoin gained 3.26% on Sunday, reversing Saturday's 0.95% fall, to end the day at $139.39.

An early morning slide to an intraday low $132.2 saw Litecoin fall through the day's first major support level at $133.08 before finding support from a shift in sentiment across the broader market. Litecoin rallied through the day's first major resistance level at $137.02 and second major resistance level at $139.08 to an intraday high $140.7, before easing back to $139 levels by the day's end.

Litecoin failed to move through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $142, affirming the bearish trend, with Litecoin ending the week down 3.49%.

At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 0.63% to $138.5, Litecoin facing strong resistance at $140, holding back a move to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $142 at the start of the day.

Litecoin managed to recover from an early dip to a morning low 137.6, though a move back through $140 to the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $142 would be needed to support a possible bearish trend reversal in the early part of the week, the day's first major resistance level also sitting at $142 levels.

Story Continues

Failure to move through $140 to test key resistance levels would likely see a reversal through the middle part of the day, bringing into play the day's first major support level at $134.16.

With the bearish trend intact, any material deterioration in market sentiment could see Litecoin test sub-$129 support levels for the first time since Friday, as investors continue to fret over what lies ahead form a regulatory standpoint.

Ripple's XRP gained 3.43% on Sunday, reversing Saturday's 0.49% loss, to end the day at $0.69852, down 4.62% for the week, Monday through Sunday.

Ripple's XRP tracked the broader market through the day, an early morning 0.66712 low holding above the day's first major support level at $0.6592 before a late morning recovery and an afternoon rally saw Ripple's XRP break through the day's first major resistance level at $0.6905 and second major resistance level at $0.7070 to an intraday high $0.71105, testing selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $0.7112.

While unable to hold on to $0.70 levels, Ripple's XRP was able to hold above the first major resistance level by the day's end, though failing to break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level continued to support the bearish trend formed in late April.

At the time of writing, Ripple's XRP was down 0.23% to $0.69697, with an early fall to an intraday low $0.68722 holding above the day's first major support level at $0.6734 before recovering to $0.69 levels, Ripple's XRP facing plenty of resistance at $0.70 early in the day.

For the day ahead, Ripple's XRP would need to break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.7112 to test the day's first major resistance level at $0.7173 and the near-term bearish trend, with any moves through to $0.72 levels likely to be in the hands of sentiment across the broader market.

Failure to move through to $0.71 levels in the middle part of the day would likely see Ripple's XRP pullback through the morning's low to test the day's first major support level at $0.6734 before any support kicks in at sub-$0.67 levels.

The report predicts that the energy footprint of the world's most popular cryptocurrency will reach 7.7GW by the end of the year, thus amounting to close to 0.5-percent of the global electricity needs. The Bitcoin network is now consuming 67TWh of energy on a yearly basis, up from 32TWh estimated by the same author in December.

The figures themselves are speculative to a degree as the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin eliminates the possibility of taking highly accurate measurements, according to the author. The estimates are hence largely derived from the computing capabilities of the Bitcoin network, though the fact that miners around the world are opting for highly diversified rigs makes direct conversions of processing power to energy consumption impossible. Mr. de Vries hence opted for the most conservative method and assumed every miner on the planet is using the most efficient rig available - the Antminer S9. Given how that's verifiably not the case, the actual energy footprint of the Bitcoin network is understood to be much higher and may even surpass a single percentage point of all energy consumption on the planet by early 2019.

The new figures underline concerns about the viability of mining Bitcoin as a business endeavor, with many critics maintaining that doing so remains nothing short of a gamble. The currency is still enjoying support from some high-profile industry veterans such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whereas a significant portion of the technology industry is presently exploring the blockchain segment in general, even if they aren't certain or even optimistic about the long-term prospects of Bitcoin itself.

If you fall among the latter category, and there exists the tiniest bit of curiosity in you, then I advise you keep your eyes glued to your screen as we would try to demystify the whole Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin concept in this post.

Bitcoin was the pioneering example of cryptocurrency that exists. However, unlike the above image, it isn't some physical form of coin or currency you can keep in your wallet. Bitcoin is basically a line of code (as in programming) with value; which can be purchased and sold for money.

Bitcoin is basically 31,000 thousand lines of code that was created by a (fake) man by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It is believed that Satoshi Nakamoto was only an alias used by the creator (whose real name, face, and overall identity remain unknown) when he invented Bitcoin in early 2009. According to Bitcoinplay.net (via TechWeez), a year after the invention of the cryptocurrency (2010), 10,000 Bitcoin could only get your two boxes of pizza. The same isn't the case today.

As at the time of writing this article, 1 Bitcoin is worth over $8,500, having almost peaked at $20,000 in 2017.

Nakamoto created Bitcoin out of the desire and thought of having a decentralized currency -- money that no authority, company, or individual had control over and owners of the currency could not be traced or identified. Like physical currency where you keep your money in your pockets, purse or a wallet, a ""Bitcoin Wallet"" is a special program that allows you store your Bitcoin and also, transfer to other users, a merchant or customer that accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment; picture it as removing a couple of naira or dollar note from your purse to give to another person.

Transfer of Bitcoin is safe, reliable and remain completely anonymous as it is a form of digital money that use encryption to secure transactions. This same encryption guides the creation of new units.

How do I get Bitcoin? you might ask. Well, for the purpose of explaining its acquisition, I'd compare Bitcoin to Oil. Bitcoin is like a commodity (a currency in the real sense of it) that you can acquire by; Buying it, or Mining (Creating) it.

Well, it would surprise you to know that mining Bitcoin is absolutely FREE! Yes, free. However, the resources and the know-how you need to possess to mine the virtual currency might cost you some dough. Before moving to the mining of the currency, there are some facts that needs to be stated forehand:

The above being said. Mining Bitcoin is a complex, capital and energy-intensive process as it requires sophisticated hardware, constant power (electricity) and internet. Presently, there are thousands of miners actively mining Bitcoin and all they do is to compete solve a complex mathematical puzzle within the space of 10 minutes. The fastest miner to successfully solve the puzzle gets rewarded with 12.5 Bitcoin (currently worth over 100,000 USD). Miners make money by selling newly generated coin to interested buyers.

Generally, to buy or sell Bitcoin, you have to have a wallet and be registered on platforms where Bitcoin are bought and sold. These Bitcoin sales and purchase websites are known as Exchanges.

The volume of Bitcoin you intend to buy or sell determines the type of buyer you are. And the type of buyer you are determines the type of Exchange you use. Exchanges like Gemini and GDAX deal with buyers and sellers of large volume of Bitcoin. Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp are trusted exchange for trading smaller volumes of Bitcoin. In Africa, you can buy or sell on Bitkoin Africa.

It is noteworthy to state that security and trust is a big factor to consider when choosing Exchange platforms to trade your Bitcoin. Back in 2016, Bitcoin worth millions of dollars we're stolen when Bitfinex, a Bitcoin Exchange platform was hacked. So be careful on which Exchange you use and how you use them. You don't want your coins stolen, do you? It is also advised to choose Bitcoin retail exchange platforms (like Poloinex) that verify customers during trade.

Depending on the Exchange, you can choose to trade your Bitcoin for cash, or other cryptocurrencies.

As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin Wallet is like a virtual purse where you store your Bitcoin...and there are different types of them:

1. Hardware Wallet

This is a physical wallet; a device specifically made for Bitcoin transactions. It connects to the internet before a transaction can be carried out and unlike other wallets, it is the most secure as it is almost impossible to hack. It may however get easily stolen..or damaged.

These are typically online wallets that can be accessed on the internet and mobile gadgets anywhere you are. It is free, easy to set up, and convenient but less secure. There are several online wallet providers but safety remains an issue since your wallet key are saved on their database; they could be hacked. Some trusted online and mobile wallets include Coinbase and Blockchain.

3. Software Wallet

This is a wallet which, just like any other software, you install on your computer. This wallet allots more control and security over your wallet but you have to ensure your computer is safeguarded against hackers and prying eyes and insured against impromptu damage by backing it up. The official Bitcoin Wallet can be downloaded on the official Bitcoin website here.

4. Paper Wallet

This is often used for long-term storage of Bitcoin. Paper Wallets are basically a piece of paper on which the private and public keys of your bitcoin address are printed. Platforms like BitcoinPaperWallet and WalletGenerator offer Paper wallets.

The cryptocurrency market continues to be a key topic for financial investors but many questions still remain about the integrity of digital currencies. We've highlighted some of the biggest stories occuring in cryptocurrency trading:

A former JP Morgan Executive believes that Wall Street will start trading in cryptocurrency in the near future, CNBC reports. Amber Baldet, who used to lead JP Morgan's blockchain division before she left, believes it won't be long until the big banks are trading digital currencies.

Her opinion carries weight, not just because of her insight into the field, but because of the movement already being made by the industry. Goldman Sachs has already announced plans to develop the first ever Wall Street bitcoin trading service.

""I think it's coming sooner than people probably think,"" Amber Baldet, Former head of J.P. Morgan's blockchain arm told CNBC's Power Lunch Friday. ""But even where the will is, the legal and regulatory framework is challenging.""

There are still obstacles standing in the way of widespread adoption though, Baldet commented. Lack of regulatory clarity was cited as one of the major challenges, with major banks having no framework to operate within . However, with Coinbase, a digital currency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, eyeing crypto custodial solutions, this could soon be changing.

Business Insider highlights how lawyers are being called upon to help blockchain companies navigate the tumultuous world of cryptocurrency. There's long been a difficult relationship between traders of digital currencies and the world's major financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Although it's currently in the process of developing its own official policy for cryptocurrency trading, the SEC has been unclear about where it stands on the topic. This means businesses operating in this sector have a difficult time knowing whether or not they're meeting standards or not.

This is why the in-house lawyers at cryptocurrency firms - large and small - are becoming the heroes of the story, Business Insider reports. Many have experience in finance law or similar areas and are proving to be a priceless resource for the companies they work for.

Bitcoin has once again rebounded as its price surpassed $8,500 and tokens such as Tron (TRX), AirSwap (AST) and Ontology (ONT) recorded gains of being 10 and 20%, CCN reports.

The news agency has previously highlighted the importance of bitcoin staying above the $8,200 threshold, as anything below this could lead to it plummeting towards the $7,900 region it experienced recently.

The bounceback is particularly notable because of bitcoin's struggles over the past few months. CCN highlights how the bitcoin price has remained between $7,900 and $8,785, failing to hit its $8,800 benchmark. This banking development, it believes, will give it a strong chance of vying for the $10,000 threshold it has so-far failed to achieve.

However, not everyone is as convinced, showing that digital currencies are still dividing opinion. UK bank Barclays said last week that the recent selloff was the result of former asset holders ""developing 'immunity' to further investment"".

""Combined with the results of our theoretical modelling, survey findings suggest that, unlike the peaks in Bitcoin prices in 2011 and 2013, the most recent peak may have been the ultimate top and that speculative interest could decrease from here,"" Barclays said.

""We estimate - with generous assumptions - that the ceiling for total cryptocurrency market capitalisation is between $660 billion and $780 billion.""",betting.betfair.com

Over 8,000 crypto enthusiasts swarmed last week's fourth annual Consensus blockchain conference, a Manhattan event that Thomas Lee, a managing partner at New York research firm Funstrat Global Advisors, had predicted would give bitcoin prices a boost.

After all, he said, during prior Consensus events prices had rallied between 10% and 70%.

Not this time: Bitcoin fell 10% last week, snapping a streak of five consecutive weekly gains and on Friday briefly dropping below $8,000 for the first time in a month.

Mr. Lee's diagnosis: ""Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions. We find that specific teams may be quite enthusiastically committed, but widespread internal acceptance of crypto/blockchain faces hurdles of indifference/inertia, legacy bias/protectionism and career risk.""

He also cited the ""chicken and egg issue."" Most entities, he said, prefer to be ""fast followers"" rather than leaders.

Still, Mr. Lee remains profoundly bullish, forecasting that bitcoin will hit $25,000 by year's end, saying he draws encouragement from the fact that a ""large share of incremental attendance"" at Consensus were financial institutions.

Ong was apprehended as part of a sting operation by Federal agents. Apart from jail time, Ong must also forfeit about $1.1 million worth of bitcoin and cash.

Ong first appeared on the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) radar in 2016 after he posted an online ad about his bitcoin trading business. Federal agents soon contacted him and in no time had set up a $12,000 bitcoin sale. Ong met with the undercover agents at a Tukwila McDonald's, and the deal went through. The agents again contacted Ong for another deal, this time worth $50,000.

One of the red flags for the undercover agents was the high fees charged by Ong. In a statement by the postal inspector to the court:

Based upon my training and experience, I know that this is a substantially higher service fee than that charged by legitimate, (Treasury Department)-licensed bitcoin exchangers.

According to the details of the operation made available to the media, Ong had a policy of not wanting to know where his clients got their money. After one of the agents let slip about drug deals, Ong is quoted as saying:

So, there is one thing I tell people is I don't really care what they use the bitcoin for. It's better that I don't actually know because then I can have plausible deniability. I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either.

After a couple of deals, federal agents confronted Ong as part of an anti-money laundering task force, whereupon he agreed to stop his unlicensed bitcoin trading activities. He broke the terms of the deal, however, and proceeded to conduct three more illegal bitcoin trades with undercover agents. Ong was arrested on July 21, 2017, and charged with five counts of money laundering and one count of running an unregistered money-transmission business. According to the indictment, Ong laundered approximately $290,000.

Since 2016, tracking domestic bitcoin traders has been a mandate of the DHS task force. It all came about in the aftermath of the arrest of David Burchard for the illegal sale of marijuana using Tor. Since then, several federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and DHS have made several arrests of unlicensed bitcoin traders. In 2017, Missouri native Jason Klein was arrested for selling roughly $75,000 worth of bitcoin to undercover FBI agents.

In 2013, the U.S. Treasury department classified bitcoin trading as a ""money services business."" Thus, bitcoin trading in the country is subject to regulations which make unlicensed crypto trading a criminal offense.",bitcoinist.com

After a spike below the $8,000 level, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,915 before starting an upside move. It gained traction and moved above the $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 resistance levels. The upside move was positive since there was a close above the $8,400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

BTC buyers got in control and pushed the price above the last swing high of $8,506. It opened the doors for more gains and it seems like the price may well test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $8,400 level. There is also a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Should the price gain bullish momentum, it could easily break the $8,600 resistance to test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low at $8,870.

Looking at the chart, the price remains well supported above the $8,400 level. A downside break below $8,400 may well call for a short-term reversal of the current trend.

And the blockchain was without rival and bitcoin was without worth and only a fringe group known as cypher punks saw the technology and said that it was good. When the Genesis Block of bitcoin appeared in January 2009, two months after a paper describing the ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"", its small group of followers realised the cryptocurrency held the potential to rip a hole right through the traditional financial system.

At the time, the world was still reeling from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a historical moment noted by bitcoin's pseudonymous creator in a message embedded in the first block of bitcoins: ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" Bitcoin's promise lay in the fact that as the world's first decentralized digital currency, it was a payment outside the scope of banks and governments and therefore immune to the pressures and whims of such institutions.

But almost 10 years on, while its potential to disrupt the established financial order is still being realised, the only thing that has actually torn apart is bitcoin itself.

You do not have access to view this Atom.

On 1 August 2017, the blockchain of bitcoin - an online ledger that documents every transaction - was split in two, spawning a brand new rival to the original cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash. The process, known as a hard fork, meant both versions of bitcoin shared the same blockchain history up until that date but from that point on would be two entirely separate entities.

There has since been more hard forks splitting the cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin gold and bitcoin private, however none were as truly divisive as that of bitcoin cash. Its purpose was to solve the two main issues that had arisen with bitcoin as its popularity grew: slow transaction times and high fees.

The scalability problem, as it is known, has served to split not just the cryptocurrency itself, but the entire community that has helped develop it over the last nine years.

The new cryptocurrency is currently only worth around 15 per cent of the original bitcoin - or bitcoin core - yet its improved functionality means some of the original cypher punks believe it is ""the one true bitcoin"". Its most prominent advocate is Roger Ver, whose involvement with bitcoin since its early days earned him the moniker 'Bitcoin Jesus'.

""Bitcoin cash has more of the characteristics that make bitcoin bitcoin, than bitcoin core,"" Mr Ver tells The Independent. ""What matters is if it works as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system - and bitcoin cash simply works better.""

The disillusionment Mr Ver felt with the original bitcoin began in 2015 when he realised that some bitcoin core supporters were in favour of high fees. Increased fees meant increased profits for some cryptocurrency companies, despite it going against the founding principles of bitcoin. The average fee for a single transaction last year was $28, making it entirely impractical for use as digital cash.

A view of Ducatus cafe, a cashless cafe that accepts cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, on their opening day in Singapore December 21, 2017 (Reuters)

Another vocal supporter of bitcoin cash is James Howells. The IT specialist from Newport, Wales, made headlines in 2013 after it emerged he had accidentally thrown away a computer hard drive containing 7,500 bitcoins, worth around £4 million at the time. At today's prices, the value of the hard drive is worth more than £50 million - it sits buried beneath trash in a landfill site near his home in south Wales for anyone who fancies a treasure hunt.

""At the time of the split in August 2017, as an early bitcoin adopter I felt I had to step up and defend the original goals and vision of bitcoin,"" Mr Howells tells The Independent.

""Bitcoin core has leaned towards catering to investors and financial companies and is no longer interested in being a usable day-to-day cryptocurrency, but wants to stay as a store of value. Unfortunately, it is the use-case as digital cash that gives it the store of value in the first place. If you cannot easily transact with bitcoin due to high fees, then how can it be a good store of value? Bitcoin cash is both.""

Mr Howell describes an online battle between the two sides, with each side trying to discredit the other and claim the bitcoin brand.

The most prominent battlegrounds have been the forums of Reddit, the social news site that has helped foster cryptocurrency communities since bitcoin's beginnings.

Along with the gripes about bitcoin core's technology, the bitcoin cash side has claimed it is the victim of censorship through posts being deleted in the main bitcoin forum.

On the other side, the bitcoin core community claims bitcoin cash advocates are partaking in a campaign of misinformation in an attempt to steal bitcoin's brand.

""They're trying to rewrite history and make use of the Bitcoin.com domain name, the r/btc Reddit section, and the @Bitcoin Twitter [account] to create a sense of ambiguation between the two coins,"" says cryptocurrency blogger Vlad Kostea in a detailed post on the feud.

""The entire scenario is very much like the propaganda you'd read from the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four: Repetition creates intellectual consent, history must be rewritten after every minor change according to the will of those in power, and words change their meaning for the sake of imposing an agenda.""

The bitcoin core side also claims that any issues with slow transactions and high fees can be solved by building new technology on top of it, such as the Lightning Network - a 'second layer' payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain to enable instant transactions.

Ultimately, by sticking to Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision, bitcoin cash supporters believe the new cryptocurrency will overtake bitcoin as the world's most valuable digital currency, an event referred to as ""the flippening"".

Among those offering bold predictions for bitcoin cash is Mr Ver, AKA Bitcoin Jesus, who believes bitcoin cash will overtake bitcoin core's market cap by 2020.

""When we're talking about upper limits, hundreds of thousands of dollars are well within the realm of possibility,"" he says, citing big investors getting involved in the new cryptocurrency. ""People love to chase a rising star.""

Beyond investors, bitcoin cash already shares some of the same characteristics as bitcoin in its early years. It has many of the same developers, together with the same kind of grassroots movement pushing for greater merchant acceptance and wider adoption. Enthusiasts have even set up a bitcoin cash 'faucet' offering free units of the cryptocurrency to encourage new users. With all this, the price of bitcoin cash is already catching up with the original and a flippening is not beyond the realm of possibility.

But bitcoin cash is just one of more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies that have emerged since bitcoin's inception in 2009, according to Coinmarketcap. It was not the first and will likely not be the last to attempt to overcome bitcoin's perceived limitations. Cryptocurrencies like ethereum and dash offer similar functionality, but without widespread adoption none will be able to fully realise bitcoin's promise of being the dominant electronic cash system.

""The limitations of bitcoin core has seen a lot of developers jump ship and move onto these newer cryptocurrencies,"" Mr Ver says, referring to a ""brain drain"" that means many of the best developers have moved away from bitcoin core.

""Ultimately, not even bitcoin cash is the one and only true version of bitcoin - People will have to read Satoshi's original white paper and decide for themselves what really defines it.""

(Dado Ruvic/Reuters)

Bitcoin miners will guzzle more electricity this year than some countries do, according to new numbers from a leading researcher. And while some critics take issue with these figures, few disagree that the digital currency's energy use is a problem that's only getting bigger.

Economist Alex de Vries studies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which were invented in 2008 by an anonymous computer programmer. Bitcoin allows people to buy and sell things directly from each other without the use intermediaries, like banks or currencies controlled and manipulated by governments.

Bitcoins are exchanged along a public digital ledger, known as a blockchain, where every move is tracked and verified by computers doing complex mathematical calculations, called hashes. Those willing to lend a hand in verifying the transactions and building the blockchain are rewarded with bitcoins.

If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. It's also hard work.

De Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are currently crunching 26 quintillion hashes -- that's 26,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 -- every second of every day.

It takes quite a bit of computational power to pull that off, and de Vries is among those taking a stab at figuring out just how much energy is used in conducting all that work, publishing his latest survey -- the first peer-reviewed research on the topic -- in the scientific energy journal Joule.

By his math, computers hashing for bitcoins -- known as ""miners"" -- are currently using at least 2.5 gigawatts of power per year, and are on track to collectively suck up more than three times that by the end of this year. That's more than Ireland, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and most Canadian provinces each use in a year.

De Vries also estimates the industry's voracious appetite for juice has doubled in the past six months, possibly due to new interest in bitcoin -- their price spiked to just under $20,000 each at the end of last year -- but also because energy-consumption growth is baked in: the supply of undiscovered bitcoins is dwindling so it takes more work to find those left.

In the early days, it was comparatively easy to find a bitcoin, as there were fewer miners competing for the work. Mining could be done by hobbyists using personal computers. But as the digital currency's popularity -- and value -- has skyrocketed, the increased complexity of the blockchain requires more energy and computing power to solve equations, and now there's specialized computing farms mining for bitcoin.

By de Vries' math, a single bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as a typical Canadian home would consume in a month -- and there's 200,000 transactions being processed each day.

""Bitcoin has a big problem,"" de Vries wrote. ""And it is growing fast.""

But de Vries' numbers and methodology are not without their critics. The economist comes up with his estimates by assuming most large-scale miners are using the most energy-efficient devices possible, then factors in how many machines are known to be in use and the cost of electricity where these machines are known to be clustered.

He admits he's taking educated guesses, partly because many bitcoin miners operate is relative secrecy.

Stanford University lecturer Jonathan Koomey says de Vries' work makes far too many leaps of logic, which results in assumptions that are likely wildly out of step with reality.

""We know there's a lot of electricity used and we know there's rapid growth,"" Koomey said in an interview. ""But nobody has been in these facilities and we don't have information on the servers themselves.""

The 800-pound gorilla of the bitcoin world is a Chinese company called Bitmain, which has huge operations in Mongolia and remote parts of China. Bitmain is a fascinating player at the company both mines for bitcoin itself, but also sells mining equipment to others.

Their most efficient model, known as an Antminer S9, has the computational power of about a half-million PlayStation 3 gaming consoles, but uses as much wattage as a dishwasher in the process, according to de Vries.

It's not hard to imagine how 20,000 of those devices -- as one of Bitmain's locations in Mongolia is believed to have -- would net an eye-watering electricity bill.

It's also not hard to understand why many of the largest mining facilities are set up in cold-weather places with a steady supply of cheap power, such as Manitoba,Quebec and Iceland. ""Rational agents would undertake mining while the marginal costs are lower,"" de Vries said.

We still don't know exactly how much the power they're using or how much they pay for it.

De Vries admits his work is only meant to be a starting off point for future research. ""I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable,"" he said.

""We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started.""

But Koomey argues it's classic scaremongering to worry about the electricity use of new technologies. Twenty years ago, he recalls that the media was full of stories about how internet usage was growing too rapidly, and reportedly destined to consume as much as half of all electricity in the world.

""I've seen this happen over and over,"" said Koomey. ""That was bunk, [so] people shouldn't jump to conclusions.""

""To be clear, [bitcoin mining] is a big user of electricity and growing rapidly,"" he said. ""But we need to be careful to not to overhype the problem.""

Koomey said he puts more stead in the work of Marc Bevand, another researcher who suggests de Vries is overestimating bitcoin's power consumption, possibly by twice as much. (Bevand has published a detailed criticism of de Vries' work online.)

Regardless of the electrical toll, some argue any amount of time and effort that is going into the mining of bitcoin is a fruitless folly.

Andreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, likens the digital currency to a major fad of the 1990s.

""Bitcoin, such as it is, has little-to-no use. So we are effectively using our planets' resources to secure people's digital versions of Beanie Babies,"" he told CBC News in an email.

""I am a fan of decentralization and blockchains, but I sincerely hope that we find mathematically and economically sound alternative approaches soon that replace this waste of resources.""",cbc.ca
42,871902385,2018-05-21,07:33:00,2018-05-21T07:33:00Z,Bitcoin's Massive Power Usage Explained in New Analysis,"At current levels, de Vries estimates Bitcoin mining uses at least 2.6GW of power per year, and that number could grow to as much as 7.7GW by the end of the year, an astounding half a percent of the entire world's electricity consumption.

Anyone can mine Bitcoins by contributing computing power to the network, but mining isn't as easy as it used to be. When you ""mine"" Bitcoin, you're actually verifying transactions on the blockchain, a distributed ledger of Bitcoin activity. Bitcoin is designed in such a way that mining gets more difficult over time, so it was possible to mine the currency with a laptop CPU a few years back. Now, you need high-power ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) hardware that can run those calculations more efficiently to have any hope of making money.

Because Bitcoin is decentralized, there's no way to know exactly how much power it uses. The numbers de Vries cites are speculative, based on the economics of Bitcoin and the efficiency of mining hardware. To get these numbers, de Vries started with the knowledge that a new block is completed about every ten minutes, and that awards 12.5 Bitcoins. That's around $15 million in mining revenues per day at current values. Importantly, more computing power does not mean more Bitcoins. Thus, as new miners join the network, it actually just takes more power to produce the same number of coins.

Are Cryptocurrencies Really the Future of Money?

Mining is a question of economics, so that's how de Vries arrived at his final estimate of Bitcoin power consumption. He made the estimate that the power bill makes up 60 percent of the cost when mining Bitcoins. The analysis also assumes that miners won't keep hardware running if it doesn't turn a profit, and electricity costs an average of 5 cents per kWh. That's how de Vries arrived at the upper bound of 7.7GW. The lower bound of 2.6GW is what you'd get if all mining operations were using highly efficient hardware like the Antminer S9. They aren't so the real value is probably somewhere in the middle.

This is already a huge amount of energy, but de Vries notes that Bitcoin energy usage could easily spike. If the price stops trending downward, more mining hardware will inevitably come online. If prices get anywhere close to the $20,000 highs of early 2018, we could blow right through the upper bound calculation. Mining rewards are designed to go down over time to limit the number of Bitcoins, so this problem won't last forever. The next drop will come in 2020 when rewards are cut in half. That should, theoretically, result in a 50 percent drop in energy usage.",albawaba.com

Bitcoins burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value.

However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.

The estimates, based on economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.

A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month.

By the end of this year, de Vries predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts -- as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.

If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 0.5 per cent of the world's electricity.

Bitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent the duplicate spending of coins.

Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.

The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins -- a process known as ""mining"" Bitcoin.

However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.

Read: Bitcoin crosses USD 12,000 mark for the first time: What you need to know about this cryptocurrency

""You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,"" de Vries said.

Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.

That information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.

Getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.

Why despite the massive increase in attendance the energy surrounding the conference felt so muffled and ultimately why it failed to provide the market bump that analysists and pundits predicted.

In hindsight, some of the problems are clear to see; the tickets were expensive and it didn't support cryptocurrency for any event transactions. Those who attended said the discussions were outdated and even NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me took a dig at the rented Lambos. Uber crypto bull Tom Lee though at least had the decency to own up to his misreading of the events influence on Bitcoin's price.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee predicted in a note to clients on May 7 that taking into account the low trading price of Bitcoin going into the conference which began on May 14th coupled with the way the market had reacted to previous years Consensus gatherings Bitcoin could gain anywhere from 10-70%. He wrote to Fundstrat's clients;

""Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years.""

As we know now Consensus did not create a market pump. In fact, Bitcoin slumped through the three day period about 10% taking the rest of the market down with it losing $45 billion since May 10, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Lee owned up to his bad prediction in a new report to clients in which he exams why the annual gathering failed to push up the price of Bitcoin. Lee wrote his investors that the continued lack of clarity from regulators like the Securities Exchange Commission and the slow pace of adoption by traditional companies were factors. According to Bloomberg, he wrote;

""Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions, but it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.""

Others who attended Consensus 2018 would agree with Lee on some of his points but were less moderate in the way they expressed their disappointment with the conference. Reddit Poster U/korgijoe started a thread entitled ""Consensus 2018: It sucked. Here's why"" in which he broke down the reasons he thought the conference was a failure which included clarity, presenters being out of touch with their core audience and the overall failure of presenters to deal with the most pressing issues of scalability and centralization.

The Reddit post which was followed by a stream of comments agreeing with and adding to the analysis ended with this conclusion as to why Bitcoin was falling during the gathering ""It was embarrassing for crypto. The market spoke."" Ever bullish Fundstrat reports they still expect to see Bitcoin hit $25,000 by the end of 2018.",newsbtc.com

Bitcoin price seems to be done with its correction and ready for a climb, but technical indicators have yet to catch up.

Technical Indicators Signals

The 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has moved past the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point as an early signal of bullish momentum.

RSI is on the move up to show that there's some buying momentum left, but the oscillator is nearing overbought conditions to reflect exhaustion. Similarly, stochastic is heading north so bitcoin price could follow suit, but the oscillator is also approaching overbought levels. Turning back down could draw sellers in once more.

If bulls are able to stay in control, they could push bitcoin price up to the next potential resistance at the 38.2% extension or $9279. The 50% extension is near the $9700 major psychological level while the 61.8% extension lines up with the swing high around $10,000. Stronger bullish pressure could take it up to fresh highs at the 76.4% extension or $10,705 level or the full extension at $11,461.

For now, though, market watchers are paying extra close attention to the energy costs related to mining bitcoin. This casts doubts on the sustainability of this particular cryptocurrency, but the improved sentiment in the industry to start the week appears to be providing enough support.

Looking ahead, the FOMC minutes could turn the spotlight back to dollar movements as stronger tightening hints could boost the US currency higher against bitcoin price once more. To top it off, a return in geopolitical risk could weigh on the riskier asset.",newsbtc.com

The billionaire e-commerce guru said bitcoin is the bubble and not blockchain. He made these comments at the recently concluded World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin.

During his address at the conference, Ma revealed that Alibaba focuses solely on blockchain implementation. According to Ma:

Blockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.

The Alibaba executive also went to say that blockchain was the true technological breakthrough that would drive the coming digital revolution. He identified the technology behind cryptos as having immense potential for all kinds of business processes. Ma also revealed that his company was exploring several blockchain applications. Alibaba is investing in data security and privacy solutions built on the blockchain. Such is the extent of the company's activities in the arena that it presently holds the most number of blockchain-related patents in the world.

Ma is, however, dissatisfied with the current extent people are exploring the technology. According to Ma, too much emphasis is placed on blockchain as a money-making tool when it ought to be used as a value creation technology. He reiterated the need for the focus to be on improving the global business process rather than treating blockchain as a ""gold mine.""

On the subject of bitcoin, Ma ironically called the world's most popular and secure blockchain, i.e. Bitcoin, a bubble. In the past, the Alibaba founder had shown a lack of interest in Bitcoin. Has even previously said that he knows little about the crypto preferring only to focus on the blockchain. Most of the company's efforts in the blockchain realm focus on e-commerce and public welfare protocols. In 2016, Alibaba launched a blockchain email repository, and in 2017, the company signed a partnership with PwC to develop a food traceability architecture based on the technology.

While previously noncommittal to the Bitcoin argument, Ma's recent comments put him with the likes of Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Bill Gates and many others. These notable business figures all have negative things to say about the world's first cryptocurrency much to the chagrin of the Bitcoin enthusiasts.",bitcoinist.com

On May 17, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency and bitcoin exchange Bitfinex officially asked its users to submit tax IDs and social security numbers that could be utilized by government agencies in the countries its users are based into tax gains recorded in the cryptocurrency market.

""We request that you complete the appropriate self-certification form and upload it to your Bitfinex account by May 24, 2018, at the latest. If you are a US person or an entity with at least one 25 percent owner who is a US person, please complete the appropriate FATCA form. You are required to provide us with such information,"" said Bitfinex.

Whalepool, a community of day traders focused mainly on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Bitfinex, emphasized that they strongly disavow the decision of Bitfinex and have withdrawn their funds from the exchange.

""Bitfinex is now requiring users to give their tax information so that it can send it to BVI which will exchange it with your country's tax authorities. We strongly disavow. If you also disagree with this decision, peacefully protest it by withdrawing your money from Bitfinex,"" the Whalepool team said.

In response to the statement of Whalepool, the Bitfinex team noted that it has ""deliberately targeted users"" that it believes have an obligation to self-disclose and emphasized that only a portion of the Bitfinex user base was asked to disclose their tax identification and personal information.

In some regions like the US and France, capital gains tax on cryptocurrency investment is quite substantial. Until this month, the gains tax imposed on cryptocurrency trading was 45 percent, which was decreased to 19 percent by France's Council of State because investors were not willing to disclose their earnings just to be taxed 45 percent.

In consideration of the high capital gains tax imposed on cryptocurrency trading, it is understandable that investors in the global cryptocurrency market try to avoid disclosing their tax IDs and prevent from being forced to pay abnormally large taxes on trades.

The abrupt decision of Bitfinex led the cryptocurrency market and investors that trade the bitcoin-to-USD, which is still the majority of investors in the market, to panic sell and withdraw their funds out of Bitfinex.

According to CryptoCompare, a cryptocurrency market data provider, Bitfinex remains as the biggest bitcoin-to-USD exchange with more than 29 percent of the market share.

The period in which Bitfinex sent out its official statement to its clients coincided with the fall in the price of bitcoin on May 17, when the bitcoin price reached a two-month low at $7,925. It is highly likely that the price drop of bitcoin was largely caused by Bitfinex and the sell-off of investors on the platform trading the bitcoin-to-USD pair.

The cryptocurrency market still remains extremely volatile. Over the past 24 hours, the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market has dropped $5 billion, from $21 billion to $16 billion. As such, it is possible that the bitcoin price falls further below from the current rate at $8,320. But, given that the market has already started to recover from the May 17 dip, it is likely that the bitcoin price rebounds soon, along with other major cryptocurrencies and tokens.",ccn.com
52,b-871644243,2018-05-20,16:35:00,2018-05-20T16:35:00Z,The Scary Inefficiency & Environmental Costs of Bitcoin - The Wall Street Examiner,"This is a syndicated repost courtesy of True Economics. To view original, click here. Reposted with permission.

Bitcoin is just one of the cryptocurrencies, albeit the dominant one by market capitalisation and mining assets deployment. The cryptocurrency is best known for volatility of its exchange rate to key fiat currencies and other commodities, but the more interesting aspect of the Bitcoin (and other cryptos) is their hunger for energy. Cryptos are based on blockchain technologies that promise a range of benefits (majority unverified or untested or both), amongst which the high degree of security and peer-to-peer data registry, both of which are supported by the mining processes that effectively require deployment of a vast amount of hash/algorithmic calculations in order to create data storage units, or blocks. In a sense, energy (electricity) is the main input into creation of blockchain records of transactions.

As the result, it is important to understand Bitcoin (and other cryptos) energy efficiency and utilisation, from three perspectives:

1) Direct efficiency - value added by the use of energy in mining Bitcoin per unit of BTC and unit of information recorded on a blockchain;

2) Economic efficiency or opportunity cost of using the energy expended on mining; and

3) Environmental efficiency - the environmental impact of energy used.

To-date, estimating the total demand for electricity arising from Bitcoin mining (let alone from mining of other cryptos) has been a huge challenge, primarily because Bitcoin miners are too often located in secretive jurisdiction, do not report any data about their operations and, quite often, can be highly atomistic. Although Bitcoin mining is a concentrated activity - with a small number of mega-miners and mining pools dominating the market - there is still a cottage industry of amateur and smaller scale miners sprinkled around the globe.

Thus, to-date, we have only very scant understanding of just how much of the scarce resource (energy) does the new industry of cryptos mining consume.

A new paper, published in a peer-reviewed journal, Joule, which is a reputable academic journal, titled ""Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem"" and authored by Alex de Viries (Experience Center of PwC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) attempts exactly this. The paper is the first in the literature to be peer-reviewed and uses a new methodology to discern trends in Bitcoin's electric energy consumption. The paper does not cover other cryptos, so its conclusions need to be scaled to estimate the entire impact of cryptocurrencies energy use.

The findings of de Viries are striking. He estimates the current Bitcoin usage of energy at 2.55 gigawatts, close to that of Ireland (3.1GW), approaching 7.67GW that ""could already be reached in 2018"", comparable to Austria (8.2GW). When reached, this will amount to 0.5% of the total world electricity consumption.

Per 'efficiency of blockchain', a single transaction on Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. Which is, put frankly, mad, wasteful and utterly unrealistic as far as transactions costs go for the network.

Per de Viries: ""As per mid-March 2018, about 26 quintillion hashing operations are performed every second and non-stop by the Bitcoin network (Figure 1). At the same time, the Bitcoin network is only processing 2-3 transactions per second (around 200,000 transactions per day). This means that the ratio of hash calculations to processed transactions is 8.7 quintillion to 1 at best. The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity.""

The key to the above numbers is that they vastly underestimate the true costs of Bitcoin and other cryptos to the global economy. The paper focuses solely on energy used on mining. However, other activities that sustain Bitcoin and blockchains are also energy-intensive, including trading in coins/tokens, storage of information blocks, etc. Worse, mining and processing / servicing of the networks required use of constant electricity supply, which means that the energy mix that goes to sustain cryptocurrencies operations is the worst from environmental quality perspective and must rely on heavy use of fossil fuels in the top up range of electricity demand spectrum. The environmental costs of Bitcoin and cryptos is staggering.

Scaling up Bitcoin figures from de Viries; paper to include other major cryptocurrencies would require factoring in the BTC's share of the total crypto markets by energy use. A proxy (an imperfect one) for this is BTC's total share of the cryptocurrencies publicly traded markets which stood at around 37.3% as of May 16, 2018. Assuming this proxy holds for mining and servicing costs, total demand for electricity from the cryptocurrencies and blockchain use around the world is more than 2.55GW/0.37 or more than 6.9GW, with de Viries' model implying that by year end, the system of cryptocurrencies can be burning through a staggering 1.35% of total electricity supply around the world.

The problem with the key cryptocurrencies proposition is that the system of blockchain-based public networks can deliver lower cost, higher efficiency alternatives to current records creation and storage. This proposition simply does not hold in the current energy demand environment.",wallstreetexaminer.com

That's a troubling trajectory, especially for a world that should be working overtime to root out energy waste and fight climate change. By late next year, bitcoin could be consuming more electricity than all the world's solar panels currently produce -- about 1.8 percent of global electricity, according to a simple extrapolation of the study's predictions. That would effectively erase decades of progress on renewable energy.

Although the author of the study, Alex de Vries, an economist and data consultant based in the Netherlands, has shared these calculations publicly before, this is the first time that an analysis of bitcoin's energy appetite has appeared in a peer-reviewed journal.

Bitcoin continues to soar in popularity -- mostly as a speculative investment. And like any supercharged speculative investment, it swings wildly. Within the past 18 months, the price of bitcoin has soared ten-fold, crashed by 75 percent, only to double again, all while hedge funds and wealthy libertarians debate the future of the virtual currency.

Beyond its tentative success as a get-rich-quick scheme, bitcoin has an increasingly real-world cost. The process of ""mining"" for coins requires a globally distributed computer network racing to solve math problems -- and also helps keep any individual transaction confidential and tamper-proof. That, in turn, requires an ever-escalating arms race of computing power -- and electricity use -- which, at the moment, has no end in sight. A single bitcoin transaction is so energy intensive that it could power the average U.S. household for a month.

A fluctuating bitcoin price, along with increases in computer efficiency, has slowed the cryptocurrency's energy footprint growth rate to ""just"" 20 percent per month so far in this year. If that keeps up, bitcoin would consume all the world's electricity by January 2021.

That simply won't happen -- government regulators would surely come to their senses by then -- but it is a sign of bitcoin's disastrous growth rate. In recent months, bitcoin supporters have criticized de Vries for being too pessimistic about its energy usage. But, as de Vries writes in the study, his estimates could also be missing out on secretive or illegal participation in the network, meaning there's maybe even more happening than meets the eye. In at least one instance that de Vries found, a researcher was caught diverting a National Science Foundation supercomputer to mining bitcoin.

It's a telling social phenomenon of late capitalism that we are willing to construct elaborate computer networks to conduct secure transactions with each other -- and in the process torpedoing our hopes at a clean energy future.",salon.com

Co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Thomas Lee has admitted that his prediction of a Bitcoin rally after the Consensus conference was wrong. Lee has claimed that the crypto market still ""faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,"" Bloomberg reports May 18

Having accurately predicted the growth of crypto markets after the US tax day in April, Tom Lee made another Bitcoin prediction on May 7, saying that the cryptocurrency will rally during and after the Consensus conference takes place in New York May 14-16. ""We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus,"" Fundstrat's co-founder stated back in the beginning of the month.

In a report to his clients Friday, Tom Lee explained his forecast was based on such factors as the crypto community coming together in a ""centralized place,"" as well as the ""growth in attendance."" These factors were expected to have a positive effect on cryptocurrency prices and ""strengthen the crypto-community's conviction.""

Although the market is positive overall, at the time of writing, the sentiment is quite negative. Maybe due to the high expectations over Consensus, which did not create that much demand over bitcoin, at least not as much as it happened during previous years.

I understand it's your money that is at stake and the market has been quite bearish. But it's also mine and everyone else's who decided to change from fiat-currency to cryptocurrency. To most people you know bitcoin is an investment vehicle; maybe a bit more worrying, is the fact that the focus is not even bitcoin anymore, it's mostly altcoins. Where else we could we get those massive gains (bruh)?

But greed comes at a cost.

I love new ideas, new projects, new ways of thinking and innovation in general. I also love the concept of decentralizing trust and money and the super-power/super-responsibility that comes with it. Obviously, the debate is considerably more interesting when the total marketcap of (insert top-10 project name) is worth billions.

At some point we need to stop and ask ourselves, how happy are we with the actual progress of the cryptocurrency space? So many companies have surged, yet where is the real change? Is there a bubble or is the market undervalued? Is price aligned with technology development and adoption, in any way?

-this article shouldn't be taken as financial advisement as it represents my personal opinion and views. I have savings invested in cryptocurrency so take whatever I write with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose and always read as much as possible about a project before investing. Never forget: with great power, comes great responsibility. Being your own bank means you're always responsible for your own money-

I have absolutely no idea, plus I couldn't care less. Don't take me wrong, I hope the market turns bullish and we do see a massive bull-run, breaking the CME futures market trend of keeping Bitcoin below 10k. I hope all projects deliver upon their promises. I hope price, technology development and business development align themselves. My desire is that everything works out just fine and everyone who invested takes home some profit.

The problem is, of course, reality works a little bit differently.

Maybe in a different universe where we make no bad choices and aren't greedy by nature, that could happen.

What I see is many projects being clearly overvalued, a definite lack of research on actual proven concepts and too much money wasted on marketing campaigns, ads, advisors, ICO trackers, paid promotional content instead of focusing on actual product development and fixing important issues.

Sure. Welcome to the VC western mentality world. You either think big or go home, right?

No. That's not why I joined cryptocurrency.

I do want to make money, get rich and don't have to worry about anything else for the rest of my days, focusing only at doing what I love. But there are many ways of achieving that goal. You don't need 1000 BTC to start a decentralizing (whatever business) platform with economic incentives. Or at least you shouldn't. One of the things that drive my passion towards cryptocurrency is what's about to come: when people with an actual need for the technology start participating, hordes at a time.

Sure, our gains are important. But there's something way bigger coming which will influence the entire marketcap.

Imagine when those 33% unbanked people around the world realize they can simply download an app and get paid in a currency accepted everywhere. The true beauty of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains to be its decentralized, permission less and transparent nature.

But in order for that to happen, we might need to put greed aside for a second and think of ways of better-redistributing money. If you don't see how that is important for your personal gain, let me clarify.

Think of what happens when you include 30 billion people on the financial system.

Can you even do it?

I cannot conceptualize the impact on our daily lives, but from a financial standpoint, this is what I see: 30 billion more customers for every business, potentially. By financially including people who did not have a chance to participate in the world economy, you can now reach new customers everywhere; because the means of exchanging are borderless and permissionless, no one can be blocked from exchanging value and services. The digitalization of the world, via mobile smart-phones with internet access, could change how we do business forever.

For example, if you do business in Africa or Latin American countries you might know it's near impossible to take money away, due to the many currency-related restrictions. You can now hop over that problem, just by transacting in cryptocurrency.

Or maybe if you're willing to train a whole new workforce, who needs much less cash to sustain an acceptable standard of living. It might not be easy but with the right set of tools, motivation and people we might see new specialized businesses flourishing through developing countries.

In order to get to the bottom of that question, first we need to worry about adoption.

I personally believe there are 3 reasons that could lead to potentially increasing worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency:

If you think I forgot about scalability, transaction fees or block size, please rest assured I haven't. To me those aren't real problems; as the network grows in security (more miners), user adoption and developer community, I believe we will see those issues getting resolved. Some others will appear, of course, but that's the nature of innovation.

You need to break stuff in order to build new things so it's not the tech problems that frighten me, to be honest; the values and paths we choose to support our decision-making, that is what concerns me. But we'll get into that in a bit.

So, why is User Interface at the top? Simple answer: would you be able to use the internet without DNS being active? If you do not understand the question, let me rephrase it: how easy would it be to, instead of accessing https://ccn.com, you would have to know a bunch of different IP addresses to be able to connect to the provider website? I'm sure you wouldn't like that at all.

Killer user-friendly apps, which make the bridge between the infrastructure and the user are the key which might unlock this puzzle.

The first real challenge is making cryptocurrency indistinguishable from digital fiat-currency. We need ways to safe-guard users from making bad decisions, like not keeping their private keys safe, accessing websites via ads, or keeping their entire assets in a single place. To achieve that, we have two main schools of thought to follow.

As regulation is usually the way to avoid, especially during the early development stages of any new technology, we should educate people and allow them to make bad decisions. It's hard to lose your money, I have been there. I have also been scammed, tricked, made bad decisions on where to store my money, lost private keys and so on. What's the only good thing about it? Each time I failed I learned something that helped me making better decisions in the future.

What ""experts"" usually don't say is that you shouldn't be afraid to fail, especially if you're starting in a new field.

Consider the following: the sooner you fail the sooner you learn. This is, if I had not made all those mistakes back in the day, I would probably do them later on. And I could have lost way, way more money!

The hardest lesson we all learn with time is that there are no safeguards in real-life. A stupid comment on twitter can lose you your job; a click in the wrong ad can infect your laptop; just being in the wrong place at the wrong time can change your life drastically.

We need to accept we don't control most things that come our way. We're either prepared to deal with them or we're not. One thing I'm pretty sure of: blocking people from investing because it's in their best interest is just dumb.

For one, how is it ok we allow some guys sitting at a table somewhere think they know better? Oh I see, they're ""protecting"" us. If it isn't morally wrong or illegal, don't even try to tell me what to do. Let me do stupid stuff and make incredibly irrational decisions. That's how I learn.

If it's ok to gamble, it should be ok to buy cryptocurrency.

If it's ok to share my data with the highest bidder, it should be ok to let me monetize it as I see fit.

Secondly, everyone makes bad decisions at some point. No exceptions here. If someone tells you how certain they are about a certain event, run like the wind. Honestly, nothing is for certain, much less an unregulated market subject to the will of the whales and institutional investors. I mean, when JP Morgan comes out saying ""We're considering entering the crypto market"" it means they're already in, as most of you know.

People are greedy by nature, right? Banks, institutions, corporations, any type of organization are just groups of people trying to get the maximum utility of each play.

Sometimes, even the greatest people make the most stupid mistakes.

Do you follow, for example, the brilliant Andreas Antonopoulos? I'm sure if you do, you think highly of him. Did you know his co-author on ""Mastering Bitcoin"", a blockchain bibble for so many crypto-enthusiasts, was the person responsible for creating Parity? Which got hacked not so long ago?

Do you think he was an idiot for trusting such a person to be his co-author?

This is the harsh truth you don't read many times. People make mistakes and bad things happen. What matters are the intentions and values on which decisions were made.

Either a commercial airplane pilot who wasn't able to account for time correctly or a doctor who failed to diagnose a disease, people sometimes make bad decisions that lead to destructive outcomes. Those events, however, can have a positive impact on future generations, because Human Beings have the capability to learn from theirs and others' mistakes. Critical thinking is key for cryptocurrency, as we cannot impose too many regulations on something that is already internally regulated. That's why Bitcoin works, as its internal consensus mechanics promote good behaviour and punish bad actors.

If you wonder why we might need to slow down on regulation think of what the current state of finance is doing to the world. There is a clear separation and segregation of classes as the rich can invest while the poor can only work for a pay-check.

Screw that. Make money work for you. This is not a new idea, not even related to cryptocurrency at all, but it's an important mmindsetto have. Maybe the story of rich-dad, poor-dad can be an inspiration to you, regarding how to look at money.

Now, let's get back on track at the question at hand.

-I hope you don't judge my rant too seriously; sometimes we just need to let it all out --

Bitcoin initiated a process of rewarding participants for securing the network. That's already pretty cool and quite an achievement, but we need to aim at doing it better. Right now you need special hardware to maintain the security of the network. In time, I hope the mechanics change in order to allow for more people to be rewarded for maintaining the network's security. Real change, in my opinion, will come from different proof-of-consensus. For example, there might be a different implementation that requires all participants to secure the network. This is, anyone who participates needs to validate transactions at some point, getting rewarded to do it.

Currently ,the logic dictates you need to spend energy to maintain the network's security, which is a fair trade-off. But other logics might appear with different goals. What if instead of energy you staked your time or attention? You do not need a massive data structure change, like switching from a blockchain to a DAG or Hashgraph, to improve consensus mechanics by giving more rewards to users.

If everyone agrees to a change in the protocol rules you can potentially just fork bitcoin into a new proof-of-work mechanic, rewarding everyone who already participates in the current bitcoin blockchain (like bitcoin cash, private, gold etc).

There are of course opinions against keeping doing hardforks, as it potentially ""steals"" hashing power from the main network. But hey, that's a feature of decentralization. People should be able to do whatever the hell they want. If someone believes they have a better way of reaching consensus, let them try. I understand the current feeling is many projects are just forking Bitcoin so that founders and early adopters get rich quick.

Is that a lie? I doubt it. Again, we humans are quite greedy. That doesn't refute the fact hardforks can have a potential good outcome!

If the overall goal is to improve the network, adoption and user reward why wouldn't you do it?! I hope people try new things, as it's the only way to achieve the best possible outcome for everybody.

Another potential solution is if businesses everywhere start adopting a different mentality. What if instead of giving people equity, you can give them a direct way to make money by using your product/services? I understand it's hard to conceptualize a token which has no real value, as it's not connected to an organization's equity, but try to see it from a different perspective: you can now purposely give away tokens to users, for free, as they use your product or service. Those tokens could let them vote upon governance, reward them with a fixed income or allow them to donate back tokens so you can build new features or maximize your business utility.

The goal here would be to directly redistribute gains, for example, among the people who support your network: users.

Those users can be anyone, your suppliers, buyers, employees, investors, etc. Everyone who interacts with your business could potentially be rewarded for participating.

Imagine not having just a source of income, but potentially dozens at the same time, just from sharing your data, buying products, using services or interacting with a network. We could completely shift how the world works by literally giving back to your network. We now have a chance to shift from measuring wealth in profits to measuring wealth in network users. Because all users would have tokens!

As crypto-assets are inter-changeable, everyone can easily exchange them for digital cash. Or any other digital asset you see fit. Maybe instead of having 150 currencies, we will end up with hundreds or thousands of digital assets, all of which could potentially be exchanged amongst themselves.

We now come to the final point that can greatly influence overall adoption.

Although this point would definitely work ""under the blockchain hood"", its key for people to trust each other. Meaning, only with standardized and trusted contracts deployed, which use a very easy and friendly interface, we actually have a chance of people trusting the entire system. It's pretty cocky to say ""the blockchain can't be hacked"" when software and websites built over it, could.

We can't forget we still live in an analogue world. People still lookup to institutions and governments for guidance and expect them to behave according to everyone's best interest and their intrinsic values.

The issue is that sometimes, leaders forget those values they swore to abide to when making decisions and base them solely on personal gain. To destroy that mentality we also need a solid and stable infrastructure aligned with a set of organizations lead by people who do not care about personal gain. Hence I understand the role Vitalik, David, Dan or Charles play at their projects.

It will depend, again, on all of us. If we promote and invest in projects just for gains, not caring about the purpose or goal, then I don't see a real future. If we make an effort to bet on projects and people who put the benefit of the many ahead of their own, then I do. I think it's up to us to let good projects and ideas live, bad ones to die and mistakes to happen.

Someone said if we do good deeds the world responds in kind.

For more than 2 centuries we had a system that only worked in some parts of the world, it wasn't all inclusive, it was permissioned and required people to identify themselves to participate. We had a system that did not work 24/7 nor did it reward participants. Come to think about it, no one born after 2008 will ever live in a world where fiat-money is the only option. That's somehow reassuring.

Things have changed and we all must make an effort to turn this market into a huge success. From investors, to developers and from miners to users, it's up to all of us as individuals to promote good agents and to punish bad actors.

Don't forget: the more selfish your actions are the worst the overall outcome for the most. I understand that for some of us to win, others need to lose; that's just how balance works. Except this time the winners can be the many and the losers the few.

I know it's a bit of a stretch, but who knows? With a different attitude comes a different outcome.

No. Our immense greed and money lust is. If you fear the market will collapse think of the Internet bubble.

Great. Now think of how you're reading this article.

No bubble will destroy bitcoin, we've been there already. Now, if there is a bubble it means we weren't able to control our greed for quick profits and allowed for enormous over-valued silly projects to emerge. Just like during the 2000s.

The only good thing is that with any failure comes an important lesson.

My only conclusion is that Bitcoin is the new digital internet money. No one was ever able to stop P2P file-sharing; do you really expect cryptocurrency will be any different? If there's a 51% attack, the network simply forks. Or you switch to a different cryptocurrency.",ccn.com

Lloyd Blankfein, 63, is expected to step down as CEO of Goldman Sachs in December, leaving the bank's future uncertain in several ways, including its relationship with bitcoin.

The New York Times reported that Blankfein will likely depart following the company's December annual dinner for retired partners. While the bank earlier this month announced plans for a bitcoin trading desk and a futures contract tied to bitcoin, its embrace of bitcoin has been undermined by Blankfein's stated doubts.

In late November, he called bitcoin a tool for fraud when its price reached $10,000, amidst reports the company was exploring a cryptocurrency trading desk. He denied the company had a bitcoin strategy and said the cryptocurrency's volatility made it a bad store of value. If it stops fluctuating 20% in a day, he said he'd reconsider.

Blankfein had said previously he was ""open"" to bitcoin and that he would not allow his own opinions to impact the company's strategy.

In early November, he said bitcoin could prove to be the ""next step"" in money's evolution. While he was uncomfortable with bitcoin, he said he felt the same skepticism with cell phones when he first encountered them.

Over the years, he noted, he has learned a lot of things work out that he does not love. He went as far as to say that in the new world, it is possible a consensual arrangement about value could exist rather than a government fiat. If bitcoin did become mainstream, he said it would be hard money's natural evolution.

Then in mid-November, he said he didn't like bitcoin and it could be a bubble.

The future without Blankfein remains unclear.

A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said most people involved in the bitcoin operation are still skeptical about it.

The company disclosed in a Feb. 26 filing with the SEC that its cryptocurrency and blockchain related investments and its intention to support clients' bitcoin futures trades could hurt the company should there be issues with blockchain protocols.

Bitcoin, however, is only one of many uncertainties the bank faces going forward.

Its mergers and acquisitions advising is far less profitable than before the financial crisis, The New York Times reported, and consumer and investment banking aren't large enough to make up the difference.

The bank has since bolstered its investment banking into mid-size cities and expanded its online lending and currencies and commodities trading for big corporations.",ccn.com

In yesterday's report, CCN noted that Aelf, the decentralized cloud computing blockchain network developed by a team of Chinese developers, increased by more than 17 percent against bitcoin. Today, on May 20, the price of Aelf increased by another 10 percent, becoming the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the market for two straight days.

Throughout May, tokens have demonstrated an intensified movement on both the upside and downside, following the price movement of bitcoin. As the price of declined, the value of tokens fell by substantially larger margins and as the price of bitcoin increased, the value of tokens surged significantly more than bitcoin.

Essentially, investing in tokens in a recovery period with extreme volatility and uncertainty is similar to leverage trading and depending on the price trend of bitcoin, the value of tokens can either plunge or surge by large margins.

On May 17, the bitcoin price reached a two-month low at $7,925 and as the bitcoin price fell, the price of Aelf (ELF) and 0x (ZRX) also fell to their monthly lows. However, as the bitcoin price rebounded from $7,925 to $8,300, ELF rose from 0.00014 BTC to 0.000162 BTC and ZRX rose from 0.00015 to 0.000174 BTC, both recording large gains against bitcoin.

Despite their 20 percent gains over the past 48 hours, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of both ELF and ZRX are at around 55, signifying a neutral zone for the two tokens. ELF and ZRX are still in an ideal position to record a short-term rally as the exponential and simple moving averages of both tokens demonstrate a positive price trend in the upcoming days.

As of current, because the price of most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and tokens heavily rely on the short-term price trend of bitcoin, investors have to focus on the price movement of bitcoin throughout the next few days.

If the bitcoin price can sustain its momentum in the $8,400 region and break the $8,800 support level, it could enter the $9,000 region relatively quickly and secure a chance to surpass the $10,000 support level by the end of May. However, if the bitcoin price falls back below the $8,200 resistance level, it is possible that the bitcoin price falls back to the $7,900 region again, which is unlikely considering the stability in the price of bitcoin since May 18.

The price of bitcoin has not been able to secure sufficient momentum to test the $8,800 support level which eventually could lead the bitcoin price to the $10,000 region in the short-term. The struggle of bitcoin can be attributed to the concerns of investors on major exchanges like Bitfinex that have started to demand users to forfeit their tax IDs and social security number, possibly due to increasing pressure from governments.

Although Bitfinex is not the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, it is considered as one of the largest cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchange and the exchange's new taxation policy led investors to panic and become fearful towards gains tax that could be imposed by the financial authorities in their countries.",ccn.com

The billionaire investor has consistently espoused the rhetoric that Bitcoin has no value. Recently, a crypto miner has taken to publicly calling out the Berkshire Hathaway chief for his negative comments.

As far as Genesis Mining co-founder Marco Krohn is concerned, Warren Buffett is not an authority on Bitcoin. In fact, he doesn't even know it all when it comes to investing. Despite a stellar investment career, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" hasn't always called it correctly. By his own admission, Buffett regrets not immediately seeing the potential in Google and Amazon. He even only reluctantly invested in Apple after first dismissing the company's stock for many years. With all of this in mind, Krohn is trying to show the public that Buffett's rhetoric should be taken with a grain of salt.

In a tweet on May 16, Krohn showed photos of billboards reminding Buffett of his past investment mistakes. The sign reads:

Warren: You said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you're wrong about Bitcoin.

What makes the campaign even more profound is that the billboard is right outside Buffett's office in Omaha. It is a not too subtle diss to an individual who has spread much vitriol and FUD about Bitcoin. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO recently called the digital currency ""rat poison."" Many in the cryptocurrency community have disagreed with Buffett with some even going as far as saying that he doesn't know anything about bitcoin.

The Buffett-bashing billboard is part of a larger Bitcoin awareness campaign organized by the mining giant. The company, which also owns one of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland, is known for such public rebukes of crypto critics. During the just concluded Consensus conference in New York, the company organized a mock protest under the aegis of ""Bankers Against Blockchain."" The rally was to enlighten people on what could become a reality in a few years' time. The parody demonstration also aimed digs at people like Jamie Dimon and the Bitcoin bubble brigade.

The company has also come down hard on negative journalistic sentiments, especially those platforms fond of posting Bitcoin obituary articles. Apart from going up against critics, the campaign also strives to educate people about the practical applications of Bitcoin, especially in remittance. Part of the campaign's mantra is that it shouldn't cost money to send money. Thus. They regularly tell people that they can send money for free using Bitcoin rather than via remittance platforms like Western Union who charge high fees.",bitcoinist.com

Earlier this year, Columbia University Business School professor Chris Castiglione stated that millennials are better suited to lead the adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum because they are capable of managing the risks associated in transacting with and investing in cryptocurrencies.

""I think the crypto market is attractive to millennials because it's a space with both a lot of growth and risk. People who are 40+ years of age are likely settled down with a career and family, and less inclined to get into such a quick growth, volatile field. It's been the same way with startup founders over the past 2 decades. Millennials also seem to be much more digitally literate than Gen X or baby boomers,"" explained Castiglione.

Cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges enable users to send, receive, store, and invest in cryptocurrencies with ease and eliminate the necessity of technical knowledge on blockchain technology and cryptographic systems. As such, by simply entering wallet addresses and maintaining back ups of private keys, it is possible for newcomers to send, receive, and store bitcoin relatively easily.

Bitcoin provides complete financial independence and freedom, as it eliminates the involvement of third party service providers like banks. Even on exchanges and marketplaces like Paxful that are peer-to-peer, users can buy and sell bitcoin without depending on financial institutions.

Consequently, because trusted third party service providers do not exist, careless mistakes such as sending funds to the wrong bitcoin address or account could result in permanent loss of funds and unrecoverable errors. Castiglione stated that to utilize cryptocurrencies, individuals must have some digital literacy and thus, millennials are better suited to adopt cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.

""Many of the people starting cryptocurrencies and tokens do seem to be between the ages of around 22-40. But obviously anything is possible, and I could list many exceptions to the rule,"" Castiglione.

In consideration of the statement of Castiglione, it is not an understatement to claim that millennials are a core part of crypto. With studies suggesting that millennials have lost trust in banks and financial institutions over the past few years, the cryptocurrency sector is in ideal position to appeal to young users.

Bitcoin service providers and peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Paxful have started to observe a rapid increase in the activity of millennials on their platforms and as millennials continue to utilize cryptocurrencies more extensively in the future, platforms like Paxful will be able to grow exponentially in terms of user base and user activity.",newsbtc.com

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.

Well, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it's not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking.

A few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can't be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.

One of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the ""Gold is owned by the Bankers"" so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement. While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it's a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:

Of the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council - Total above-ground stocks 2017) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.

Now, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???

First, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:

According to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn't more than 10,000-15,000 mt.

Secondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:

Of the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.

For there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.

So, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.

Regardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.

Unfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public's money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.

Now, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.

If we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:

Bitcoin's 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin's volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.

Secondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology. I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant's life.

In just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.

Not only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.

Unfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble.",investmentwatchblog.com

In fact, the market reversed and is now trading at a monthly low! As usual, investors are wondering where the market will go from here.

Contrary to popular expectation, Bitcoin failed to rally 69 - 130% after the Consensus conference in New York ended this week. In fact, it pulled back nearly 5% as the cryptocurrency market capitalization sank to $389 billion and it appears that the downtrend is set to continue for the short term.

Fortunately, things still bode well for crypto as:

Keeping this in mind, at present there is still more tangibly good news than bad news in the crypto-hemisphere and volatility is nothing new to cryptocurrency investors... though all of the moonshot valuations and promises of tripling market caps may have led us to forget this.

After a nearly 5% drop, BTC briefly touched a monthly low at $7,925 on Bitfinex. As shown on the daily chart, this is a nearly 50% retracement of the pre-April rally low of $6,425.

On 18th May BTC had continued a pattern of lower highs and lower lows and the daily chart shows BTC below the 100 and 200-day MA and at the time of writing the RSI sits below the 50 indicating that bears have the advantage.

There is a smidgen of positive news for the short term as around midday Saturday the 5 and 10-day MA changed direction and BTC is close to exiting the recently developed downward channel. On the other hand, both the 20 and 50-day MA are sloping downwards and BTC needs to cross the 50-day MA at $8,400. At the time of writing BTC still trades below the 50-day MA suggesting short term continuance of the bearish trend.

If BTC is unable to recover or hold above $8,000, there are long term supports at $7,800 and $7,600 but how likely these are to hold is questionable as $7,784 is at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement. A close below $8,000 means that a reversal favorable to the bears is in place and the ensuing sell off could drop prices to $7,000 or lower.
